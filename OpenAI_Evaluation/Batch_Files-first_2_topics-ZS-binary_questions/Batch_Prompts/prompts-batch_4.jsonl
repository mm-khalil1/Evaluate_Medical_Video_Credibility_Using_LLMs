We all know that bed wetting can be both uncomfortable and embarrassing for a child Thankfully almost all the kids will eventually outgrow it as time goes on But chances are that you as a parent will feel compelled to do something while you wait So that is why today we are going to talk about 5 different ways to get rid of bed wetting Number 1, don't praise and don't punish Well, if your kid happens to wet his or her bed What you need to do is don't say anything, just don't say the word Just go ahead and change the bed You also need to realize that this is embarrassing for the kid and it is uncomfortable for them So don't say anything, don't punish, don't embarrass the kid Don't scream and yell at the kid, just change the bed and say nothing You know eventually that this is going to go away as time goes on On the other side of the coin, don't praise Let's say for a period of time the bed is dry, the kid doesn't wet the bed Don't call him or her and praise him, just don't say anything So don't praise when they are dry and don't punish when they are wet Number 2, change for the better To help minimize psychological stress, try as much as possible to rearrange the child's bedroom So that it will give them the opportunity to change the bedspread by themselves You can also help by setting out inside the room a felt covered rubber pad So that when he has an accident, he can actually lay this rubber pad over the wet part of the bed At the same time, he can also put out a pair of dry pajamas so that he can change into shooting case he has an accident Remember this is embarrassing for the kid and every time this happened to him or her, they felt really uncomfortable So by doing these two changes, there is a possibility that the child won't feel as if he or she has been treated like a child or like a baby That need bed change every time Number 3, about bed wetting alarms The question is, does the bed wetting alarm really work or not? They sure do work Bed wetting alarms can work but you better be patient when you use them The alarm is very loud and chances are good that they wake up everybody in the house when it goes off This is the way bed wetting alarm operates, it emits or rings out a sound when the child is wet The theory here is that the sound will condition him or her to wake up when he needs to urinate Eventually, wetting will be inhibited and bladder distention will become a signal for the child to get up if he is about to wet the bed You should realize that many children respond to this type of conditioning strategy within about 60 days It is important to know that bed wetting can be killed and bed wetting is considered killed when the child remains dry for 21 consecutive nights We have a lot of bed wetting alarms in the market, a lot of them, but you just have to compare the one that is better for your child Some of these alarms run on hearing aids and batteries and can actually trigger moisture sensors that are attached directly to the underwear of the child Try as much as possible to buy the new bed wetting alarm in the market instead of just sticking to the older one 4. Boost bladder muscles If you are a parent and you notice that your child's daytime pattern is one in which it goes to the bathroom fairly often Then there is a possibility that bladder stretching exercises may work Now this is the way to practice bladder stretching exercises If the child drinks a lot of fluid during the daytime, then practice bladder control by holding off urination for as long a period of time as possible This technique can be very effective and control bed wetting during bedtime 5. Show patience and support Now if you are a parent, you must understand that all kids outgrow bed wetting at the rate of 15% a year This means that by the time they go through the stage of adolescence, less than 1 or 2% will see wet the bed So be patient and be supportive You see, no kid wants to wet on himself. It is unpleasant, uncomfortable and cold And besides, only babies do that and no kids want to be a baby So, patience and support is the bottom line So understand, like I said, it is uncomfortable and embarrassing for the kid And there you go, the 5 new ways to get rid of bed wetting Please don't forget to visit our website at www.amirajim.com At the same time, please try to support this channel by subscribing to our channel In fact, I want you to stop what you are doing right now, whatever you are doing right now, stop And click on that subscribe button at the bottom of this video And at the same time, I'd like you to click on that bell notification icon So I can keep on sending you new videos when I upload one Thank you again and we see you next time"}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Bedwetting is a little more common than people are aware because it's also a best kept secret. Not many people are running around and advertising that their child is bedwetting at the age of 5, 6, 7, 10, 14 years old. But bedwetting does have a relationship to how we're breathing and our quality of sleep. Some of the causes for bedwetting relate to the way oxygen is exchanged in our body. The way I'll describe it is this. If we're breathing through our mouth, that air coming into the lung isn't really filtered, warmed, or humidified appropriately, and the body can't exchange it appropriately. So a little less oxygen goes to the brain. Now the brain is a very sensitive organ. When the brain recognizes little changes in oxygen, it goes to work immediately. Because once the brain starts to recognize a little less oxygen, it doesn't know if we're being choked to death, a very serious condition, or if there's an imbalance in how we're breathing at night. But it does start to trigger a little bit of the fight or flight response. And a little bit of the fight or flight response means the brain's going to look at the body and say, all right, if we've got a little bit of an oxygen issue going on, I'm going to pull oxygen from something that it picks to be unnecessary right now and maybe deliver it somewhere that might be more important, planning on the rare occurrence as if the oxygen was going to stop. So if the brain's recognizing a little less oxygen, all of a sudden it's pulled from the urinary tract. If the body pulls a little oxygenation from the urinary tract, it might void.

Bedwetting is a little more common than people are aware because it's also a best kept secret. Not many people are running around and advertising that their child is bedwetting at the age of 5, 6, 7, 10, 14 years old. But bedwetting does have a relationship to how we're breathing and our quality of sleep. Some of the causes for bedwetting relate to the way oxygen is exchanged in our body. The way I'll describe it is this. If we're breathing through our mouth, that air coming into the lung isn't really filtered, warmed, or humidified appropriately, and the body can't exchange it appropriately. So a little less oxygen goes to the brain. Now the brain is a very sensitive organ. When the brain recognizes little changes in oxygen, it goes to work immediately. Because once the brain starts to recognize a little less oxygen, it doesn't know if we're being choked to death, a very serious condition, or if there's an imbalance in how we're breathing at night. But it does start to trigger a little bit of the fight or flight response. And a little bit of the fight or flight response means the brain's going to look at the body and say, all right, if we've got a little bit of an oxygen issue going on, I'm going to pull oxygen from something that it picks to be unnecessary right now and maybe deliver it somewhere that might be more important, planning on the rare occurrence as if the oxygen was going to stop. So if the brain's recognizing a little less oxygen, all of a sudden it's pulled from the urinary tract. If the body pulls a little oxygenation from the urinary tract, it might void. So we might wet the bed."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Yes, bedwetting is part and parcel of this noble job. However, as most moms know, bedwetting isn't naughty, lazy or attention-seeking behaviour. Most often, bedwetting is a developmental issue. This means that most children wet the bed because they haven't yet mastered bladder control. As they grow older, the brain and the bladder will communicate better, even when they sleep, and will help them to wake up when their bladders are full. There may be other reasons too, such as constipation, deep sleep or low levels of a chemical that is called antidiuretic hormone, or ADH. This hormone regulates the body's water retention and plays an important role in how much urine the body makes. Sometimes, stress also brings on bedwetting, especially in older children. So be alert when you move house, have relationship problems, welcome a new baby into the family or when your child starts or changes schools. Most children feel embarrassed or ashamed by these mishaps. Don't make a fuss or reprimand them when this happens. Rather explain to them that it's normal and that as they grow and their bladders get bigger, it will eventually stop. Some simple steps can help you to manage bedwetting. Encourage your child to drink more during the day. Limit any drinks after 6pm. Make going to the toilet part of the bedtime routine and keep clear from caffeinated drinks. You can also put a waterproof sheet on the bed and let them wear washable waterproof underwear at night. Remember that teasing your child about bedwetting can make the problem worse. Some children may be too scared to go to the toilet in the dark. Give them affordable nightlight to make it easier for them to go to the bathroom. The good news is that most children stop daytime wetting when they turn 3 years. Nighttime bedwetting on the other hand usually only stops at 5. The secret is to be patient. Many preschoolers and even some primary school children will still wet their beds occasionally. It's also slightly more common in boys than in girls. Discuss your concerns with your general practitioner. The doctor may run some tests to rule out possible medical conditions. Also remember that emotional distress can cause children to start bedwetting all over again, for example from pressure at school. Doctors distinguish between two types of bedwetting, namely primary and secondary bedwetting. Primary bedwetting means that the condition has been continuous since early childhood without a break. Primary bedwetting starts again after a dry period of at least 6 months. The doctor may run some tests to rule out any possible medical conditions like urinary tract infection, diabetes or anatomical or neurological problems. In extreme cases, your doctor may recommend medicine or a bladder training programme. Counselling or even hypnosis can help children with emotional issues. You may also want to talk to your doctor about bedwetting alarms. These will alert your child and tell them to go to the toilet. This system also teaches them to wake up before they wet the bed. Praise your child for every dry night to boost their self-confidence. Remind them that bedwetting is nothing to be ashamed of, that many other children do it too and that it will soon stop. Remember, one of your most important duties as a parent is to ensure that your children feel safe and loved as they grow."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

And one of the common things that we see in our office is kids that may have a Nocturnal Enuresis or bed wetting. And I don't know if you knew this, but chiropractic care can help with making sure that the brain is able to send all those messages down to let the bladder know that the bladder is full and the child needs to urinate. A lot of times parents don't realize that if the nerves are being compressed or what we call subluxation they may not be able to know that they need to wake up in the middle of the night and use the restroom. Now, something that I have right here is this is a case study that was done with the resolution of Nocturnal Enuresis and this was done in a 10 year old who was experiencing bed wetting for over 6 years after following a urinary tract infection which they did multiple rounds of antibiotics. After receiving her chiropractic adjustments, she was able to have the resolution of bed wetting and her parents, I'm sure, were really excited. So if you know anyone out there that may be dealing with this common challenge that may be embarrassed, maybe they don't know what to do, call our office at 440-471-4200 or check out our blog, we're a part of the ICPA, which is the International Chiropractic and Pediatric Association and we're here to help make a difference in your family.

But what age should they be growing out of all of that? And what does it mean if your 6, 7, 8, or even 9 year old is still having accidents in their sleep? Dr. Mary Anne Lofromento is the author of the Simply Parenting series and she joins us now from New Jersey with all the answers. Dr. Lofromento, thanks for making a house call to Smart Family. Oh, my pleasure. Nice to see you. Hey, when do most children stay dry at night? Well, most children will stay dry at night by age 6. I think that's kind of the cut-off point for most doctors of what's normal. Anything, you can really start wetting, you can keep wetting the bed up until age 6 and it can be completely normal. Okay. And then what causes bed wetting? What really causes it, the most common cause is that it runs in your family. If a child is wetting the bed between the ages of 6 and 12, 13, then most likely either the father of the child or some other relative has also been wetting the bed. It's very common, more common in boys than in girls. And with each year, although there'll be a drop off of a percentage of children who will stop bed wetting, it can actually go on until about 12 or 13 in some cases. Wow. So genetic factors there are a big one. Can a child have just a small bladder? Yes, they can have a small bladder. They could sleep too soundly, that's another reason. They could have a slight abnormality of one of the hormones that keeps urine in. And occasionally stress can make a child start bed wetting when they've been dry. Okay, difficulty waking up, that can be another one, right? Yes. Yeah. And then slower than normal development and that always makes us a little bit nervous when you're talking about that because we're just not sure what's on par. So we're going to start at six and anything after that we'll talk about in a moment. Okay, so then let's go into what does not cause bed wetting because that's important too. Absolutely. I think that's the most important job I have when I sit down with parents. It is not your child's fault. They cannot control this. It is not a behavioral problem. So what are the treatments then for bed wetting? Because I know you can either talk medicine or you can talk behavioral. Let's do the behavioral first because parents can actually really help with that part. Absolutely. And medicine is always a last resort when it comes to children. The most common things are you limit fluids right before bedtime. Some parents, their child doesn't drink anything after five o'clock. Then you have them go to the bathroom immediately when you're starting kind of getting ready for bed and then right before they usually fall asleep. You kind of nudge them, get them in there. Those are kind of the first line of treatment. And what can your doctor do to help? I'm sorry. So then what can your doctor do to help if those things aren't working? If that's not working, they're going to do a careful exam. They're going to test the urine, make sure there's no infection, make sure there's no diabetes. But they're also going to recommend maybe a bed wetting alarm system. That works for many, many motivated kids especially if they're nine years old or ten. A little detection of any kind of moisture which happens right before they would normally start peeing and that puts an alarm out and the child wakes up and goes to the bathroom. That really helps a lot of kids. Hey, you know the other thing we should talk real quick because we're almost out of time here is that there's a real emotional process here that happens with kids who wet their bed. They feel horrible about it. How can parents help them? Be supportive. Do not make them feel guilty. They can help with clean up if there is a bed wetting but do not make them feel like this is their fault. Just tell them you're going to grow out of it and everything will be fine and we can use some medications at a last resort, go back to the doctor. They'll give them something even if it's just for sleepovers. Alright, very good. Dr. Mary Ann Loferman, thanks so much for being with us. We appreciate it."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Dr. Mary Anne Lofromento is the author of the Simply Parenting series and she joins us now from New Jersey with all the answers. Dr. Lofromento, thanks for making a house call to Smart Family. Oh, my pleasure. Nice to see you. Hey, when do most children stay dry at night? Well, most children will stay dry at night by age 6. I think that's kind of the cut-off point for most doctors of what's normal. Anything, you can really start wetting, you can keep wetting the bed up until age 6 and it can be completely normal. Okay. And then what causes bed wetting? What really causes it, the most common cause is that it runs in your family. If a child is wetting the bed between the ages of 6 and 12, 13, then most likely either the father of the child or some other relative has also been wetting the bed. It's very common, more common in boys than in girls. And with each year, although there'll be a drop off of a percentage of children who will stop bed wetting, it can actually go on until about 12 or 13 in some cases. Wow.

At the age of six, 15%. And at the age of 18 plus, between 1 to 2% are still suffering from bedwetting. In the States, it's estimated that there are between five to seven million children and teenagers that are still suffering from bedwetting. Tal Sagi and his father, Jacob Sagi, have helped more than 30,000 children in Israel over the past three decades. Sagi says parents often make mistakes. For example, a lot of parents wake up their child during the night. They try to help him. They want to prevent the bedwetting. But by doing that, they're taking all the responsibility from the child's side to their side. They limit the child's liquids, which is not so recommended as well. They punish him sometimes. They compare him to other siblings. Now they're offering their therapy program online. The kit comes with a state-of-the-art sensor and a plastic sheet. Parents input data on how often the children have accidents, and a virtual therapist responds. Both kids and parents like the interactivity, and the price is $250, as opposed to thousands for a live therapist. In Israel, much of it is covered by insurance. So what the child gets is a real therapist speaking to him, asking him questions. He will answer by clicking the right answer with the mouse on the screen. And then he'll get the right feedback. So we managed to create a virtual therapist that is doing exactly what we've been doing in the traditional program. Sagi says early results show the online program works just as well. And he can send it all over the world, even to Arab countries like Dubai via Europe. He says he hopes to reach hundreds of thousands of children all over the world.

Tal Sagi and his father, Jacob Sagi, have helped more than 30,000 children in Israel over the past three decades. Sagi says parents often make mistakes. For example, a lot of parents wake up their child during the night. They try to help him. They want to prevent the bedwetting. But by doing that, they're taking all the responsibility from the child's side to their side. They limit the child's liquids, which is not so recommended as well. They punish him sometimes. They compare him to other siblings. Now they're offering their therapy program online. The kit comes with a state-of-the-art sensor and a plastic sheet. Parents input data on how often the children have accidents, and a virtual therapist responds. Both kids and parents like the interactivity, and the price is $250, as opposed to thousands for a live therapist. In Israel, much of it is covered by insurance. So what the child gets is a real therapist speaking to him, asking him questions. He will answer by clicking the right answer with the mouse on the screen. And then he'll get the right feedback. So we managed to create a virtual therapist that is doing exactly what we've been doing in the traditional program. Sagi says early results show the online program works just as well. And he can send it all over the world, even to Arab countries like Dubai via Europe. He says he hopes to reach hundreds of thousands of children all over the world.

Welcome back to our educational series for parents. Today we're going to talk about bed wetting. Please remember that these video blogs don't replace consultations with your physician. If you have concerns, make an appointment with your doctor to be seen. We'll be happy to see you here. Area code 775-359-7111. We're experimenting with a new tripod here at the request of several of our regular viewers, so if we're having some difficulty, bear with us. This is a learning experience for all of us. So bed wetting. Bed wetting up until realistically the age of six is not even an issue. The average age of toilet training success for girls is about three years of age and about three and a half for boys. So prior to three and a half years of age, it's not considered abnormal to not be toilet trained at all. And after three and a half to four years of age, about one out of ten boys and about one out of ten girls is not yet toilet trained. Especially at night. So to have episodes of bed wetting that lasts six, seven years of age is hardly unusual if it's happening to ten percent of the patient population. About ten percent of the patients who experience bed wetting after age six get better each year. The majority of these cases are what we refer to as idiopathic Enuresis. There's no known cause. However, if your child after age six is having bed wetting, it is important to be evaluated by a physician. We want to, among other things, sorry about that. So we want to make sure among other things that there's no evidence of sacrocoxigeal tumors, dysfunction of the genitalia, abnormal genitalia, missing parts, extra parts, parts not in the right place, stuff such as that. That's pretty easily ruled out with an appropriate physical exam. That then leaves us with regular bed wetting. And of course when we're talking about regular bed wetting, we're talking about bed wetting that's persisted for a long time. New onset bed wetting is a completely different disease and completely different list of things to worry about. So if your child has been dry at night and is starting to wet the bed all of a sudden, we want to see that child quickly. And there's a lot of things that can do this including diabetes and it's very dangerous. So if your child is a new onset bed wetter, we want to see you right away. Don't waste time. Please come in and see us. But for the chronic bed wetter who really has never been dry for any length of time, what is the most common cause? Well the most common cause realistically is altered sleep. Most of these children are sleeping so deeply they don't recognize the signals from their bladder to get up and use the bathroom. And so they sleep right through it. Many of these kids don't even realize they've wet the bed until morning. If you use bed wetting alarms for these children, the alarms go off, they'll wake up the entire house, but not the child who's wet the bed because he's so sound asleep. So the real treatment is to reprogram the sleep phase for the child. And we do that by waking them up in the middle of the night. So they go to bed at their usual time and mom or dad needs to wake the child up when they go to bed. And the goal is to alter the sleep to prevent that altered deep sleep that's not really a normal sleep phase. And in so doing, we can avoid the sleeping right through the signal and eventually the children will learn to recognize the signals from their bladder to get up. Once they are able to be easy to arouse and wake up, then we can start using bed wetting alarms to further train them and finish the training of the process and ending the problem. We do want to make sure that the child doesn't have obstructive sleep apnea. That's another cause that can cause chronic bed wetting and that's something that needs to be treated usually through a pulmonary sleep center. A little more difficult to take care of. Fortunately that one's not quite as common as the altered sleep sensations. People ask me regularly, what about medicines for my child? The reality is there is no medicine to cure idiopathic Enuresis of childhood. It takes time. There are some medicines that will help with the problem including a nose spray called DDAVP and an antidepressant called imipramine. However remember if we put your child on these medicines, they stop the brain's ability to learn how to deal with the sensation of a full bladder. Consequently they are a temporary bandaid. When we take the child off the medicine, they regress back to where they were when we started the medicine. So all it does is delay the time necessary to achieve dry nights. So what is the role of medicine? Well the role of medicine is for summer camp, for sleepovers, to be able to allow your child to do normal childhood things but on a day to day basis they are a bandaid and they do not solve the problem. The child must have his or her sleep retrained and we do that by waking them up in the middle of the night. Remember again we are talking about long standing never been dry children. Children who have had dry nights for months to years who suddenly start wetting the bed we want to see them right away. That's something very dangerous and potentially very dangerous and needs to be evaluated quickly. I hope this has helped to shed some light on a very common, very complicated situation. Remember that again 1 out of 10 children have this problem after age 6 and about 80% are dry by 9 years of age but that means of those children who have bed wetting 20% are having problems after 9 years or 10 years of age. So if your child is one of those children although it's a very frustrating situation the good news is you're in very good company. It's not the end of the world and most of these children, almost all of these children go on to achieve dryness at night. We just need to be patient, make sure there's no long term emotional scars when we're done. This is Dr. Windisch, if we can be of assistance please give us a call at our office, area code 775-359-7111. We'll see you next time."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Welcome back to our educational series for parents. Today we're going to talk about bed wetting. Please remember that these video blogs don't replace consultations with your physician. If you have concerns, make an appointment with your doctor to be seen. We'll be happy to see you here. Area code 775-359-7111. We're experimenting with a new tripod here at the request of several of our regular viewers, so if we're having some difficulty, bear with us. This is a learning experience for all of us. So bed wetting. Bed wetting up until realistically the age of six is not even an issue. The average age of toilet training success for girls is about three years of age and about three and a half for boys. So prior to three and a half years of age, it's not considered abnormal to not be toilet trained at all. And after three and a half to four years of age, about one out of ten boys and about one out of ten girls is not yet toilet trained. Especially at night. So to have episodes of bed wetting that lasts six, seven years of age is hardly unusual if it's happening to ten percent of the patient population. About ten percent of the patients who experience bed wetting after age six get better each year. The majority of these cases are what we refer to as idiopathic Enuresis. There's no known cause. However, if your child after age six is having bed wetting, it is important to be evaluated by a physician. We want to, among other things, sorry about that. So we want to make sure among other things that there's no evidence of sacrocoxigeal tumors, dysfunction of the genitalia, abnormal genitalia, missing parts, extra parts, parts not in the right place, stuff such as that. That's pretty easily ruled out with an appropriate physical exam. That then leaves us with regular bed wetting. And of course when we're talking about regular bed wetting, we're talking about bed wetting that's persisted for a long time. New onset bed wetting is a completely different disease and completely different list of things to worry about. So if your child has been dry at night and is starting to wet the bed all of a sudden, we want to see that child quickly. And there's a lot of things that can do this including diabetes and it's very dangerous. So if your child is a new onset bed wetter, we want to see you right away. Don't waste time. Please come in and see us. But for the chronic bed wetter who really has never been dry for any length of time, what is the most common cause? Well the most common cause realistically is altered sleep. Most of these children are sleeping so deeply they don't recognize the signals from their bladder to get up and use the bathroom. And so they sleep right through it. Many of these kids don't even realize they've wet the bed until morning. If you use bed wetting alarms for these children, the alarms go off, they'll wake up the entire house, but not the child who's wet the bed because he's so sound asleep. So the real treatment is to reprogram the sleep phase for the child. And we do that by waking them up in the middle of the night. So they go to bed at their usual time and mom or dad needs to wake the child up when they go to bed. And the goal is to alter the sleep to prevent that altered deep sleep that's not really a normal sleep phase. And in so doing, we can avoid the sleeping right through the signal and eventually the children will learn to recognize the signals from their bladder to get up. Once they are able to be easy to arouse and wake up, then we can start using bed wetting alarms to further train them and finish the training of the process and ending the problem. We do want to make sure that the child doesn't have obstructive sleep apnea. That's another cause that can cause chronic bed wetting and that's something that needs to be treated usually through a pulmonary sleep center. A little more difficult to take care of. Fortunately that one's not quite as common as the altered sleep sensations. People ask me regularly, what about medicines for my child? The reality is there is no medicine to cure idiopathic Enuresis of childhood. It takes time. There are some medicines that will help with the problem including a nose spray called DDAVP and an antidepressant called imipramine. However remember if we put your child on these medicines, they stop the brain's ability to learn how to deal with the sensation of a full bladder. Consequently they are a temporary bandaid. When we take the child off the medicine, they regress back to where they were when we started the medicine. So all it does is delay the time necessary to achieve dry nights. So what is the role of medicine? Well the role of medicine is for summer camp, for sleepovers, to be able to allow your child to do normal childhood things but on a day to day basis they are a bandaid and they do not solve the problem. The child must have his or her sleep retrained and we do that by waking them up in the middle of the night. Remember again we are talking about long standing never been dry children. Children who have had dry nights for months to years who suddenly start wetting the bed we want to see them right away. That's something very dangerous and potentially very dangerous and needs to be evaluated quickly. I hope this has helped to shed some light on a very common, very complicated situation. Remember that again 1 out of 10 children have this problem after age 6 and about 80% are dry by 9 years of age but that means of those children who have bed wetting 20% are having problems after 9 years or 10 years of age. So if your child is one of those children although it's a very frustrating situation the good news is you're in very good company. It's not the end of the world and most of these children, almost all of these children go on to achieve dryness at night. We just need to be patient, make sure there's no long term emotional scars when we're done.

Nocturnal Enuresis is the fancy word for bedwetting. What we do with the, we're going to use the example of a child, a child who is a bedwetter and this is of course a child who is consistently wetting the bed. This is not a two or three-year-old who is wetting the bed. We're starting to be concerned let's say about our six and seven-year-old child who is still wetting the bed every night. It is a maturity thing, it's not a I'm drinking too many liquids before I go to bed or I'm being a lazy kid, it's a brain maturity thing. The brain secretes a hormone that tells us, those of us who don't wet the bed, it tells us at nighttime to decrease urine output. Well these children, their brain is, it's not secreting that message or it's not sending that message to see urine production and output at night. So we want to retrain the body to be able to do that. So what we're going to do is we're going to fit the child with a Nocturnal Enuresis alarm. That alarm you pin it to the child's pajamas up at the top and then it has a little sensor that you pin in their underwear where the monitor will sense moisture and at the first time that it senses moisture a really loud alarm sound goes off and of course that causes the child to wake up. The reason that is the unconditioned stimulus and unconditioned response is no one had to teach this child when this alarm goes off you wake up. It is loud, it causes the child to unconditionally respond to wake up. Well when we pair that with the sensation of a full bladder because when the bladder is full and out comes urine the alarm goes off and of course then the child wakes up. So what we do is we pair this together every time at night when the child is sleeping we have them sleep with this alarm monitor. Every time there's moisture the alarm goes off so the sensation of the full bladder also moisture coming from the bladder being urine output. So we pair this together enough times and research shows that with continual consistent working with the Nocturnal Enuresis monitor that there is a good outcome. We've had a personal experience in our family using it and it took two weeks. We had one of our children who is six years old who consistently wet the bed every night. We called him bed wetters but of course you know now we have pull-ups and goodnight diaper type things for older kids so you don't necessarily hear kids referred to as bed wetters anymore but we did this and it took two weeks of consistent usage to retrain her brain and her bladder and her body to wake up and she no longer suffers from Nocturnal Enuresis. So intervention can it behavior modification intervention is number one before you would want to try something like medications with the child because this classical conditioning example is very very effective."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}
