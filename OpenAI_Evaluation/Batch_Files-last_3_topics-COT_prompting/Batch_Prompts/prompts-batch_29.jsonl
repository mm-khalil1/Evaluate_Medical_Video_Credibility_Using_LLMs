The case is a 54 year old female. The background was two vaginal deliveries, two episodes of trauma over the coxis and repetition cystitis. For the last four years, she complains about dyspareunia and pain in the left vaginal and perianal region. The pain is worse with defecation and urination. The pain is very intense, 9 in the visual analogical scale and gets worse throughout the day and when sitting up. It's a pain in bed and allowing to sleep normally. Clinical findings, sensibility, research, intense pain when pressing the left ischial spine, pelvic MNR without pathological findings. See the guided pudendal block, positive diagnostic response. Based on Nantes criteria, the patient was diagnosed of left pudendal neuralgia and trait in the pain unit by neuromodulator drugs and radiofrequency following our protocol. The outcome was unsatisfactory, so the surgery was decided. The surgeon is placed in the side opposite to the nerve to be released. We usually use four truckers, three of five and one of ten millimeters. We are located in the left side of the pelvis and our first objective is locating both, the umbilical artery that is going to be our medial limit and the iliac vein that will be our lateral limit. Once the umbilical artery is located, the peritoneum between the vein and the artery is cut as mentioned and we access to the obturator fossa. We move forward in our dissection downwards and towards. Here we meet up again with the umbilical artery that as we are saying it's our medial limit. We keep moving forward and the next structure that we are going to find is the obturator nerve that is going to serve as well as lateral limit. Right below the obturator nerve, the obturator vein appears. This vein is surrounded by the fat tissue that we should medially reject in order to make progress in our dissection. It's convenient to create an adequate field of vision because as you can see this area is fully occupied by relevant vascular structures with a high risk of bleeding. That way having an adequate field will make easier in case we have any incident during the surgery. We keep moving forward and here we are getting rid of more adipose tissue and we come up with a muscular structure named myotendinous arc. This structure is important because right below it we locate the sciatic spine that is a key anatomic point in this surgery because the sacral spinal ligament is inserted in it. In this moment we are cutting the coccygeus muscle that is a thin and wide muscular structure that covers the sacral spinal ligament. It's convenient to use some sort of energy system. In this case we are using bipolar energy because this is a structure that bleeds with relative ease. Once we finish cutting the coccygeus muscle the sacral spinal ligament is exposed. This is a strong fairly wide structure that we will cut as close as possible to the sciatic spine. When we start cutting the sacral spinal ligament the pudendal neurovascular complex structures appears. Here we can see both the pudendal vein and artery. We keep cutting the ligament until reach a fatty tissue that will indicate the end of our section and the beginning of the alkyl scanal. Here we can see the fat tissue. Right in this moment the pudendal nerve is left uncovered and completely released.

Damage to the pudendal nerve can occur suddenly as a result of trauma to the pelvic region, prolonged bicycling, fractures or from falls. The pudendal nerve re-enters the pelvis under the sacrotuberous ligament and gives three branches. The first branch, the inferior rectal nerve, provides rectal tone and perianal sensation. The second branch, the perineal nerve, gives scrotal sensation. The third branch, the dorsal nerve of the penis, gives branches to the corpus callosum. The pudendal nerve arises from S2, S3 and S4. The pudendal nerve carries sensation to the external genitalia, the lower rectum and the perineum. Symptoms of pudendal nerve palsy can start suddenly or develop over time. The symptoms include loss of sensation or numbness, burning or stabbing pain, difficulty with bladder and bowel function, and sexual dysfunction. Causes include prolonged sitting exercises such as bicycling or following fracture table traction. Treatment options include rest, physical therapy, stretches and exercises, anti-inflammatory medication, injection or nerve block, surgery as a last resort.

And those can be used interchangeably, and sometimes they cannot. We're gonna specifically call out one case in this series that was in fact a pudendal nerve pain and we know that for sure. So we are going to look at these three cases, starting with the youngest gentlemen...all these will be males. Pelvic floor pain, I don't remember what specific side, but it also included some genitourinary symptoms...such as problems with an erection. I'm gonna go ahead and draw in some of the changes so you can see the shift that's here in the body. This is the lower pelvic area, this is splitting the middle of the pelvis and you can see how on the image on the left the upper body masss leans over towards the right. We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues. The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up. Okay so that was the final installment of \"10 patients in 10 minutes.\" Dr. Zachary ward here at Life In Alignment Chiropractic, If you've any questions about anything in this video, or any of the other videos (clearly we've gone over one minute for this video) but you can look up more at LIAChiro.com.

And those can be used interchangeably, and sometimes they cannot. We're gonna specifically call out one case in this series that was in fact a pudendal nerve pain and we know that for sure. So we are going to look at these three cases, starting with the youngest gentlemen...all these will be males. Pelvic floor pain, I don't remember what specific side, but it also included some genitourinary symptoms...such as problems with an erection. I'm gonna go ahead and draw in some of the changes so you can see the shift that's here in the body. This is the lower pelvic area, this is splitting the middle of the pelvis and you can see how on the image on the left the upper body masss leans over towards the right. We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues. The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up.

We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues. The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up.

The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up. Okay so that was the final installment of \"10 patients in 10 minutes.\" Dr. Zachary ward here at Life In Alignment Chiropractic, If you've any questions about anything in this video, or any of the other videos (clearly we've gone over one minute for this video) but you can look up more at LIAChiro.com.

So I'm grateful and thankful for anyone out there that needs to have something done that Dr. Agala can help them with. She definitely needs to do it.

I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day. I'm Dr. Alan Mandel."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day. I'm Dr. Alan Mandel."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day.

I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid.

I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day. I'm Dr. Alan Mandel."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}
