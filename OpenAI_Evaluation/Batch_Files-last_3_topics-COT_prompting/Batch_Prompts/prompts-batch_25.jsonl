The main aim of my making this video is to raise awareness about this condition, not only amongst the patients but also amongst the medical fraternity. Hi I'm Dr. Amod Manocha. I'm a pain specialist and I work at the Max Hospital in Delhi as the head of the pain management services. Let me describe a typical patient who presents to my clinic with this problem. So most patients who present to my clinic would be young or middle aged male or female patients with pelvic pain. Before they come to my clinic they have normally seen numerous specialists which may include neurologists, general surgeons, neurologists, gynecologists and often internal medicine specialists. They've had numerous investigations but despite that no cause can be found which can explain their pain symptoms. And often their life is at a standstill because it affects not only their working capacity but also their sitting ability and their sexual life. These patients have normally done a lot of internet research before they can come to the diagnosis or come to the suspicion that pudendal nerve might be the problem in their case. So let me describe the symptoms which these patients present. So the main presenting complaint is pelvic pain which may feel like a burning, shooting, aching sensation and this may be located in the genital area such as the penis or the scrotum or the vagina or the labia or the perineal area. The perineal area is the area high up in between the two legs. The pain may also be located close to the sit bones and often it goes down on the inner side of the leg. Now this pain is associated with urinary symptoms and most patients describe it as if they have got a urinary infection which means they say they have to go to pass urine more often. There is often pain while they are passing urine accompanied by a burning sensation. Along with this they may have bowel symptoms or stool symptoms such as increased urge to open bowels, irritation or itching sensation around the area when they are passing stool or even pain when they are passing stool. Along with this one of the other major symptoms is sexual dysfunction which means they have pain when they are aroused, when they are having intercourse or when they are having an orgasm. They can in males especially, there can be pain after ejaculation as well and you can understand the implications of this and how this can affect the life of people. Before we move any further I think it is important to know a little bit more about the pudendal nerve. So pudendal nerve is one of the major nerves in the pelvis and there is one on each side. Now this nerve has an important role in controlling the urine and the stool control and it also carries the sensation to the genital area. So let me explain you a little bit more with the help of this animation model. So if I remove the skin and the muscles and the yellow ones you see are the nerves. Now the one which I have highlighted is the pudendal nerve and you can appreciate that it comes out of the spine and travels towards the front. If I rotate the spine then you can see this clearly and this nerve which you see is the pudendal nerve. Now to help you understand and appreciate it a little bit more let me isolate the nerve. So what you see now is the pudendal nerve coming out of the spine and then travelling forwards and during its course it will give different branches which will go to different areas like the rectal area, the genital area and the perineal area. So if I put the skin back then you will be able to appreciate where this nerve is located and what's its course. Let's move further and talk about what can cause the pudendal neuralgia symptoms. So any pressure on the nerve as while cycling or bike riding or prolonged sitting can lead to the appearance of the typical symptoms and often for this reason this condition is also known as the Cyclist's Syndrome. Training of the nerve as during childbirth can also lead to the typical symptoms. Other causes of pudendal neuralgia can include injury to the nerve as well as a surgery or a trauma or infections in the area such as herpes. Now this condition can be quite challenging to diagnose and what we sometimes use is special MRI scans to look at these nerves. Depending on the availability we may also use nerve conduction tests and these are special tests but what can help us diagnose with a little bit more confidence is diagnostic nerve blocks. So if we numb these nerves with the help of injections and the pain goes away then that can be a clue to the diagnosis. So for treating this condition what we use is a multidisciplinary approach which means we use different modalities together to try and give you the maximum benefit from it. We have to undertake some lifestyle modifications which are aimed at protecting the nerve giving it an opportunity to heal. Now these lifestyle modifications include using a special cushion while we are sitting, avoiding tight throats to avoid pressure on the nerve, avoiding constipation so that the nerve does not get further damaged, avoiding things like bike riding, avoiding things like horse riding and prolonged sitting. Along with this what we use is physiotherapy aimed at specifically the pelvic floor muscles. We also use medications which are special type of medications which works on the nerves and are called neuropathic medications. Now these medications can take some time to produce their effect and often we have to start with the lower dose and then gradually increase the dose till you get the benefits from it. Another important modality what we use in the treatment is injections. We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them. Thank you once again."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them. Thank you once again."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

And you're watching Demystifying the Pelvic Floor, weekly videos providing real and simplified pelvic floor education for real clinical situations. We've got you covered. And today we'll be talking about pudendal neuralgia and why you should consider the pelvic floor muscles. What is the pudendal nerve and what is pudendal neuralgia? So the pudendal nerve, as you can see from this photo, runs on bilateral sides of the pelvic floor muscles and innervates the clitoris, perineum, labia, and anal sphincter. The pudendal nerve can become compressed, irritated, inflamed, which can lead to neuralgia of that nerve. It's a subset of vulvodynia and it can cause pain in the nerve distribution. This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after. Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve. And if it reproduces the patient's symptoms or creates a zinging and a referral into the distribution of the nerve, then that's considered what we call a positive Tenel sign or a neuropathic irritation that could be causing some of the patient's symptoms. So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

And you're watching Demystifying the Pelvic Floor, weekly videos providing real and simplified pelvic floor education for real clinical situations. We've got you covered. And today we'll be talking about pudendal neuralgia and why you should consider the pelvic floor muscles. What is the pudendal nerve and what is pudendal neuralgia? So the pudendal nerve, as you can see from this photo, runs on bilateral sides of the pelvic floor muscles and innervates the clitoris, perineum, labia, and anal sphincter. The pudendal nerve can become compressed, irritated, inflamed, which can lead to neuralgia of that nerve. It's a subset of vulvodynia and it can cause pain in the nerve distribution. This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after. Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve.

This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after. Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve. And if it reproduces the patient's symptoms or creates a zinging and a referral into the distribution of the nerve, then that's considered what we call a positive Tenel sign or a neuropathic irritation that could be causing some of the patient's symptoms. So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

And you're watching Demystifying the Pelvic Floor, weekly videos providing real and simplified pelvic floor education for real clinical situations. We've got you covered.

I'm a surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Reconstruction and I specialize in the microsurgery of nerves. Pedendal neuralgia is a compression of the pedendal nerve. So what that amounts to is the pedendal nerve is in someone's pelvis. It's the nerve that goes to their genitalia, to their perineum, to the anus, that whole entire area down there. And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them.

I'm a surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Reconstruction and I specialize in the microsurgery of nerves. Pedendal neuralgia is a compression of the pedendal nerve. So what that amounts to is the pedendal nerve is in someone's pelvis. It's the nerve that goes to their genitalia, to their perineum, to the anus, that whole entire area down there. And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia.

It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed.

And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis.

I'm a surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Reconstruction and I specialize in the microsurgery of nerves. Pedendal neuralgia is a compression of the pedendal nerve. So what that amounts to is the pedendal nerve is in someone's pelvis. It's the nerve that goes to their genitalia, to their perineum, to the anus, that whole entire area down there. And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed.

The objective of this short talk is presentation how to do pudendal nerve block and how to do trigger point injections and injections to the pelvic floor. After ensuring informed consent from patient, patient is positioned in dorsal atotomy position with legs and stirrups. Equipment required for pudendal nerve block is following. Sterile gloves, mucus, povidone iodine or stanchaxidine, 10 cc controlled syringe, Iova Trampet, 20 gauge 15 cm spinal needle, regular spinal needle for transpirinal approach, 1% local anesthetic. Prior to doing pudendal nerve block you would like to be sure that the spinal needle is appropriate length. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet. Tip of the spinal needle should be 1.5 to 2 cm longer than Iova Trampet. Prior to performing pudendal nerve block we need to identify ischial spine first. Two fingers are introduced in vagina and then on the lateral vaginal wall there is a prominent which is ischial spine and if you gently push on this it will cause discomfort with patient. Ischial spine is marked with a pink marker on the side wall. Local anesthetic and spinal needles are ready. Iova Trampet for patient right side is mounted on the right hand of the surgeon with the opening on the top and tip of Iova Trampet is between two fingers. After placing lots of mucus, fingers are gently placed into vagina. After we identify ischial spine, trumpet needle is introduced. Tip of the trumpet needle is pointed at the ischial spine, moved 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and pushed gently against vaginal mucosa. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet until resistance is met. For the teaching purposes this is how long is tip of the needle outside Iova Trampet. The needle is further introduced 1.5 to 2 cm into tissue around pudendal nerve with an aspirated syringe to confirm there is no intravascular placement and then solution is then injected. Following injection spinal needle is slowly withdrawn leaving Iova Trampet in place and then Iova Trampet is removed slowly. I just injected 10cc of ampersand xylocaine to patient's right side. Now we are going to switch the side. Iova Trampet is placed in surgeon's left hand. Iova Trampet is introduced in vagina. Left ischial spine is found. Tip is placed 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and 10cc of ampersand xylocaine is injected again. Pudendal nerve block is now complete.

Ischial spine is marked with a pink marker on the side wall. Local anesthetic and spinal needles are ready. Iova Trampet for patient right side is mounted on the right hand of the surgeon with the opening on the top and tip of Iova Trampet is between two fingers. After placing lots of mucus, fingers are gently placed into vagina. After we identify ischial spine, trumpet needle is introduced. Tip of the trumpet needle is pointed at the ischial spine, moved 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and pushed gently against vaginal mucosa. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet until resistance is met. For the teaching purposes this is how long is tip of the needle outside Iova Trampet. The needle is further introduced 1.5 to 2 cm into tissue around pudendal nerve with an aspirated syringe to confirm there is no intravascular placement and then solution is then injected. Following injection spinal needle is slowly withdrawn leaving Iova Trampet in place and then Iova Trampet is removed slowly. I just injected 10cc of ampersand xylocaine to patient's right side. Now we are going to switch the side. Iova Trampet is placed in surgeon's left hand. Iova Trampet is introduced in vagina. Left ischial spine is found. Tip is placed 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and 10cc of ampersand xylocaine is injected again. Pudendal nerve block is now complete. You should wait 5 minutes and check how effective is your block."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Your anesthesiologist is a doctor who specializes in the relief of pain and administering anesthesia to patients having surgery. A nerve block is a type of anesthesia where the anesthesiologist injects numbing medication around a nerve or nerve bundle which will block the feeling of pain in part of your body. The nerve block may also cause weakness in the same area. Right before your surgery, your anesthesiologist will discuss the nerve block with you and answer any questions you may have. The nerve block is usually done right before your surgery. It may be performed in a special area or in the operating room. Your team will place monitors to watch your vital signs and give you extra oxygen to breathe during the procedure. Before beginning your nerve block, your anesthesia doctor will go through a safety checklist to confirm the right procedure is being done on the right patient. Once you have been placed in the proper position, your anesthesia doctor will be ready to begin the nerve block. Placing the nerve block will usually take 5 to 15 minutes. It will take longer if your doctor is placing a nerve block catheter. As your doctor begins the procedure, they may give you a small amount of medicine through your IV to help you relax during the procedure. The medicine will not knock you out. It is important for you to be awake during the nerve block so that you can follow any instructions and let the doctor know if you are feeling any pain or discomfort during the process. The next step is for your doctor to clean the area where the block will be placed with an antibacterial soap. Most nerves are just a few inches beneath the skin. Your doctor may use a special machine that uses sound waves to identify the nerve. Once the nerve has been located, the actual nerve block can begin. Your doctor will place a small amount of numbing medicine at the skin. Once your doctor has located the nerve with the ultrasound machine, they will then place a small blunt needle right next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort, such as sharp or shooting pain. This will allow your doctor to adjust the location of the needle. Once the needle is properly positioned, the doctor will inject numbing medicine next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort during the injection, ringing in your ears, a metal taste in your mouth, feeling dizzy, or anything else unusual. This may be due to problems with the injection. Once the nerve block is finished, many patients may feel the nerve block beginning to work after only a few minutes. It may take up to 45 minutes for the nerve block to reach its maximum effect. You may feel a numbness or tingling sensation, or even weakness in the muscles of the body part where the nerve block was placed as it begins to work. Certain surgeries may have strong pain for several days. Because a single injection of numbing medicine with a nerve block only lasts 8 to 24 hours after it is placed, you and your anesthesia doctor may decide that it would be best for you to have a nerve block catheter. A nerve block catheter is a very small tube, about the size of fishing line. It is placed through the needle so that it is next to your nerve. Numbing medicine may be given through the tubing for several days to make your nerve block last longer. Once the nerve block catheter is properly placed, the needle will be removed. Your doctor will use tape and other bandages to hold the catheter in place. They will inject the catheter with numbing medicine and ask you how you were feeling to help them detect any problems with the injection. After the first numbing medicine is injected, your doctor will hook up your catheter to a pump, which can drip a small amount of numbing medicine around the nerves for several days."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Your anesthesiologist is a doctor who specializes in the relief of pain and administering anesthesia to patients having surgery. A nerve block is a type of anesthesia where the anesthesiologist injects numbing medication around a nerve or nerve bundle which will block the feeling of pain in part of your body. The nerve block may also cause weakness in the same area. Right before your surgery, your anesthesiologist will discuss the nerve block with you and answer any questions you may have. The nerve block is usually done right before your surgery. It may be performed in a special area or in the operating room. Your team will place monitors to watch your vital signs and give you extra oxygen to breathe during the procedure. Before beginning your nerve block, your anesthesia doctor will go through a safety checklist to confirm the right procedure is being done on the right patient. Once you have been placed in the proper position, your anesthesia doctor will be ready to begin the nerve block. Placing the nerve block will usually take 5 to 15 minutes. It will take longer if your doctor is placing a nerve block catheter. As your doctor begins the procedure, they may give you a small amount of medicine through your IV to help you relax during the procedure. The medicine will not knock you out. It is important for you to be awake during the nerve block so that you can follow any instructions and let the doctor know if you are feeling any pain or discomfort during the process. The next step is for your doctor to clean the area where the block will be placed with an antibacterial soap. Most nerves are just a few inches beneath the skin. Your doctor may use a special machine that uses sound waves to identify the nerve. Once the nerve has been located, the actual nerve block can begin. Your doctor will place a small amount of numbing medicine at the skin. Once your doctor has located the nerve with the ultrasound machine, they will then place a small blunt needle right next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort, such as sharp or shooting pain. This will allow your doctor to adjust the location of the needle. Once the needle is properly positioned, the doctor will inject numbing medicine next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort during the injection, ringing in your ears, a metal taste in your mouth, feeling dizzy, or anything else unusual. This may be due to problems with the injection. Once the nerve block is finished, many patients may feel the nerve block beginning to work after only a few minutes. It may take up to 45 minutes for the nerve block to reach its maximum effect. You may feel a numbness or tingling sensation, or even weakness in the muscles of the body part where the nerve block was placed as it begins to work. Certain surgeries may have strong pain for several days. Because a single injection of numbing medicine with a nerve block only lasts 8 to 24 hours after it is placed, you and your anesthesia doctor may decide that it would be best for you to have a nerve block catheter.
