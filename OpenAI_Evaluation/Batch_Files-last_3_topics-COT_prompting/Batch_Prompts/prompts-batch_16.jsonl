First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little red structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. Once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and that it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric caudary. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which everts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. It usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand, and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Using small double hooks, we're able to dissect with care taken again to remove the tissue but get down to the flexor tendon sheath. The pulley is now identified and an attempt is made to identify the radial nerve and neurovascular structures. You can see the nerve there. So a crowd retractor is then placed in to retract the nerve. Here you can see the pulley and you can see the proximal edge of the pulley is illustrated here by our scissor. We will use a knife to incise the proximal edge extending distally. Here we can see the pulley begin to open. We then use a tonotomy scissor to complete the release distally. Care is taken again not to injure the tendon or disrupt the neurovascular bundle and now proximally the release is completed as well. The pulley leaflets are easily identified and they're easy to note complete release because of the redundancy that is now in the leaflets. Any residual catching or triggering which is noted with active flexion is then released. Here again we can see smooth motion of the tendon itself and now the skin is closed using a 3-0 nylon suture.

The typical incision that I like is a transverse incision in the distal palmar crease. The nodules on these tendons are usually palpable and the incision is made over the nodule. The incision is usually in the 1 cm range. The skin is opened and deeper dissections are accomplished with the scissors using a spreading technique. The spreading is done along the long axis of the digit with care not to injure any neurovascular structures. A superficial palmar fascia is released and the A1 pulley is then identified. Once the pulley is identified it is incised and opened. Depending on the nature of the tendon nodule, a portion of the pulley may be removed or a synonym around the tendon may be resected as well. A complete release of the A1 pulley is accomplished. The finger is checked for triggering. The fondness of the tendon is also looked at to be sure there is no nodularity associated. In this case there was extra synonym around the tendon and this was removed. The wound is enclosed with floral monofilament usually in a mattress fashion to divert the skin edges.
