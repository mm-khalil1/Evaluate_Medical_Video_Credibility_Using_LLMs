I had the surgery yesterday and it took about 35 minutes, probably 3 hours of getting prepared and being released and stuff like that. I convinced them to let me watch the surgery through the entire procedure and it's truly an amazing thing. This is, just so anyone knows, this is what the aftermath will look like for 6 days or so. And then I can remove this and have the stitches out and start doing hopefully some things with my fingers. This was the trigger finger and I can already actually bend it. I don't feel the catching of the trigger finger anymore. So who knows what will happen as it heals but as of this point it seems positive. I quickly described the surgery where I saw and let go of that I think for now. They cut a, probably a half inch hole in my hand and it's by a node where the tendons are going through this node to get to this finger here. So this decision is essentially right there. And then they use some forks to stretch out the skin wide enough so that they can pull out the tendons and operate on them. The tendons are incredible looking things like the most perfect rubber bands, pure white rubber bands. They have a very strong feeling. They pulled them out and stretched them so that they pretty much filled my palm with those two tendons going through the finger. So they had these two tendons out, stretched apart, perhaps two inches apart with what felt like a huge amount of tension on them. And there was obviously a lot of growth over the years that occurred on those tendons that was causing this problem. The tendons were cut off and scraped off and disposed of. And then this little myelin sheath, which is just like an eyelet on a fishing rod or something, at least metaphorically, was slit so that there would be more room I think in case there was more regrowth or something. I was able to test the finger while I was in the midst of this, when it was done actually. So I made a complete fist. It seemed like it was the first time I had been able to move the finger in a month I guess. Anyway, this morning is utterly miserable. You know, this astounding amount of pain in my fingers are just now really becoming unknown. You know, because there's a lot of local anesthetic involved in this thing. Even that wasn't really enough to keep the pain from being there, but it worked well enough. And I thought the surgeon was really good in terms of explaining things while he was doing them and allowing me to see this in the first place I guess. Usually this is a, whatever it's called, the Michael Jackson probe, propofol or something, type of operation where you're out cold. So that's the deal. I hope to be playing pretty soon.

I had the surgery yesterday and it took about 35 minutes, probably 3 hours of getting prepared and being released and stuff like that. I convinced them to let me watch the surgery through the entire procedure and it's truly an amazing thing. This is, just so anyone knows, this is what the aftermath will look like for 6 days or so. And then I can remove this and have the stitches out and start doing hopefully some things with my fingers. This was the trigger finger and I can already actually bend it. I don't feel the catching of the trigger finger anymore. So who knows what will happen as it heals but as of this point it seems positive. I quickly described the surgery where I saw and let go of that I think for now. They cut a, probably a half inch hole in my hand and it's by a node where the tendons are going through this node to get to this finger here. So this decision is essentially right there. And then they use some forks to stretch out the skin wide enough so that they can pull out the tendons and operate on them. The tendons are incredible looking things like the most perfect rubber bands, pure white rubber bands. They have a very strong feeling. They pulled them out and stretched them so that they pretty much filled my palm with those two tendons going through the finger. So they had these two tendons out, stretched apart, perhaps two inches apart with what felt like a huge amount of tension on them. And there was obviously a lot of growth over the years that occurred on those tendons that was causing this problem. The tendons were cut off and scraped off and disposed of. And then this little myelin sheath, which is just like an eyelet on a fishing rod or something, at least metaphorically, was slit so that there would be more room I think in case there was more regrowth or something. I was able to test the finger while I was in the midst of this, when it was done actually. So I made a complete fist. It seemed like it was the first time I had been able to move the finger in a month I guess. Anyway, this morning is utterly miserable. You know, this astounding amount of pain in my fingers are just now really becoming unknown. You know, because there's a lot of local anesthetic involved in this thing. Even that wasn't really enough to keep the pain from being there, but it worked well enough.

Usually this is a, whatever it's called, the Michael Jackson probe, propofol or something, type of operation where you're out cold. So that's the deal. I hope to be playing pretty soon. I don't think it's going to be one of these two-day things, but even this just gets in my way. But I think that when this comes off that it won't be long and that will be pretty much my PT is typing, playing, and the million other things that I do.

The synovial tendon sheath and the tendon are clearly shown. Inflammation of the tendon sheath is known as stenosing tinosinovitis. Stenosing tinosinovitis of the thumb, often referred to as trigger thumb, is one of the more common abnormalities of the hand. This condition is associated with painful triggering or locking of the thumb. When the patient tries to straighten the thumb, the nodule jams beneath the pulley proximally. This occurs with a painful snap, much like a trigger being pulled and released, with either flexion or extension of the thumb. Small changes in the tendon's diameter will have a significant effect on the function of the thumb. The nodule is usually pulled proximally to the pulley with active thumb flexion. That includes anti-inflammatory medication and injection. Inject into the sheath, not the tendon. Put the needle obliquely towards the tendon. Withdraw the needle slightly and inject freely into the sheath. Ultrasound guided injection of the tendon sheath and pulley may be of benefit. The needle is inserted into the sheath above the tendon and fluid is injected. If symptoms persist, consider surgery. Release the pulley to allow active motion without triggering. Note the position of the radial digital nerve close to the incision. Everything seems to be fine with this thumb, but there's definitely something tricky going on with this one.

When you go to grab something it's just like\u2026 It's just stuck here, you see that? So it's stuck, he's not able to. So you have to, and this one too, but that's open, you see? It's not as bad but it still pops. It pops but here, are you trying to open it by yourself? Yeah he's trying. You can relax your hand. Let's bring it this way. Can you see that? Try to open this one. It's just stuck. You see the shakiness of his hand? Okay let's do the same thing here. Try to open it. Here you go, he's able to open it here but it's very slow but here it's just totally stuck. So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck? Yeah it's stuck completely. Now it's hanging up and it's not sticking. Nowhere near as bad as it used to. So before you manually have to do this. Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down? Yeah this is my predominant hand. Yeah I'm glad you're doing better. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Feel free to subscribe to my channel to get helpful tips on how to relieve pain.

It's just stuck. You see the shakiness of his hand? Okay let's do the same thing here. Try to open it. Here you go, he's able to open it here but it's very slow but here it's just totally stuck. So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck? Yeah it's stuck completely. Now it's hanging up and it's not sticking. Nowhere near as bad as it used to. So before you manually have to do this. Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down? Yeah this is my predominant hand. Yeah I'm glad you're doing better. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Feel free to subscribe to my channel to get helpful tips on how to relieve pain.

So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck? Yeah it's stuck completely. Now it's hanging up and it's not sticking. Nowhere near as bad as it used to. So before you manually have to do this. Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down? Yeah this is my predominant hand. Yeah I'm glad you're doing better. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Feel free to subscribe to my channel to get helpful tips on how to relieve pain.

Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb is a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and it allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb is a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and it allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb is a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and it allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site.

A lot of times this occurs in people that use their hands a lot, and trigger finger might develop just from simple overuse. Typically, if a patient with trigger finger were to go see their doctor, they might be recommended to get a steroid shot to decrease the inflammation of the tendon and the sheath and allow everything to move more freely.

Most commonly, trigger finger affects the ring finger and the thumb. It's also called synosyntinosynovitis, but it's obviously easier to call it trigger finger. What happens in this condition is the tendons that allow us to move our hands like this actually get stuck, so to speak, in the sheath, the covering of the tendon, or basically the tunnel that they have to travel through in order for us to be able to move our fingers freely. A lot of times this occurs in people that use their hands a lot, and trigger finger might develop just from simple overuse. Typically, if a patient with trigger finger were to go see their doctor, they might be recommended to get a steroid shot to decrease the inflammation of the tendon and the sheath and allow everything to move more freely. In theory, that sounds nice, but the reality is that steroid shots actually increase risk of tendon rupture, which is why people are limited to the number of steroid shots that they could get each year. And people with trigger finger a lot of times may undergo a steroid shot only to find that everything just really comes right back sometime later.
