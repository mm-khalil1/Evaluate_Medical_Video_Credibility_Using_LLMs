Long cord-like structures called tendons connect these muscles to the bones in your fingers and thumb. A tunnel of tissue called a tendon sheath surrounds each tendon. This allows the tendon to glide smoothly as the fingers move. The sheath is held in place by bands of tissue called pulleys. They hold the tendon close to the bone for optimal functioning of the tendon. When your flexor muscles contract, the pulleys help guide the tendons to flex or bend your fingers. Normally, the tendons glide smoothly through the pulleys when the fingers flex and extend. Trigger finger, also known as trigger thumb, or stenosing tenosynovitis, is a condition where the pulley at the base of your finger becomes inflamed and swollen. This makes it harder for the tendon to move through the pulley. Over time, the tendon may also swell and form a bump near the pulley. When you bend your finger, the swollen area on the tendon may cause a catching or triggering sensation as it initially gets hung on the pulley and then slips underneath. If not treated, the tendon may swell enough that it cannot pass beneath the pulley. As a result, your finger may get stuck in a bent position. If you have trigger finger, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: a tender lump on your palm at the base of your finger. A catching, popping or locking sensation when you move your finger. And pain when you bend or straighten your finger. The cause of trigger finger isn't known but some conditions that can increase your risk for it include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and repeated injuries, forceful and repetitive hand gripping may also increase your risk. To treat mild trigger finger, your doctor may advise you to rest your hand and avoid activities that make it worse. Your doctor may prescribe antiinflammatory medication or a corticosteroid injection to reduce the swelling. You may also need to wear a finger splint to keep your finger straight. If non-surgical treatments haven't worked, your doctor may advise you to have a surgical procedure. To start the procedure, your surgeon will make a small incision in your palm. Then the pulley will be cut to free the tendon. At the end of the procedure, your incision may be closed with stitches and covered with a soft bandage.

Mostly geriatric population. I've been in home health for the last three years. But a little tender. Okay. So Gary why are you working? Tell us about yourself. I've been a chiropractor for 14 years and I do home health now. And I was a physical therapy assistant for 15 years before that. So I was the oldest guy in my chiropractic class. So what? Mostly focused on soft tissue work. Didn't do a whole lot of adjusting. So what do you think about the ASTR class? You had three days of class so do you feel you're ready to work on patients? Pretty much yes. It seems to be a lot more efficient. Feel that loosen up? It's moving so much better. That really feels good. Alright. Let us know if you feel any pain okay? Just don't scream in the kitchen. That one is really restricted. You really have a bad case of trigger finger by the way. This is severe. Like I did when I was in high school. 12 So let's use the instrument and we'll. Okay. It doesn't move. It doesn't move. Do you feel you have more grip with the instrument? Easier? Yeah. In some parts. Bigger. There he is. Do you feel that difference? Mm hm. No more. And it's interesting to feel the different areas have different directions of resistance. That's correct. Is it easier to feel it with your hand or the instrument? No it's pretty easy with the instrument. It makes it easier for you? Mm hm. Easier than I thought it would be. Less pain with my hand? Less effort with the instrument you mean? Yes. Yeah, because if you use your hand repetitively with a lot of patients might have arthritis from repetitive strain injury. Overuse. So let's go for A3, A4. We'll get the whole thing. Okay. You guys feel free to switch different persons just to get the feel of working on different body parts. Did you see the trigger finger? Before. It was severe like stuck like this. Oh. Yeah. For two years. More painful proximal? Yeah. Okay. But they're there okay. Oops sorry. You're doing good Johnny.

Less effort with the instrument you mean? Yes. Yeah, because if you use your hand repetitively with a lot of patients might have arthritis from repetitive strain injury. Overuse. So let's go for A3, A4. We'll get the whole thing. Okay. You guys feel free to switch different persons just to get the feel of working on different body parts. Did you see the trigger finger? Before. It was severe like stuck like this. Oh. Yeah. For two years. More painful proximal? Yeah. Okay. But they're there okay. Oops sorry. You're doing good Johnny. I'll get the whole thing proximal like the whole muscle tendons. Yep yep just get the whole the whole muscle. You'll do it. Really dig in. And you also can use the A4, the A3. Even the bigger one? Uh huh. Okay pressure okay. Can you feel the scar tissue? I can see it here. Right there. Do you guys see it? With the enhancement it's just uneven. It jumps. Yep you can see that exactly. And so you want to. I'll put more lotion. Do you want me to do the side too? Do you want me to do the side more? Yeah. For him. For him. Sometimes. And it's really bad he was just stuck like nothing moving when he make a fist. I feel most of the scar tissue there. Through here. Right here. Make sure you do the antagonist of that finger right in the finger. So you can do the other one. Now would you do the section at a time? Just clean the whole house quickly. Yeah save time. You okay with the pressure? So what happened there? There's kind of scar like right there. What's going on? Maybe I scratch it. Okay so that's good. Let's clean it up and we'll test his range of motion again. So you said your pain was how much at worst when you did the first fist today? About 6. Okay so let's clean that up and just have this in there. Yeah and get your hands up. On your clothes so it will be okay. Alright let's open it. Assuming I'm gripping. Oh wow. Oh my goodness. Yeah it's in the video. Even he's scared. How was it before? It was stuck like this. No resistance. So you couldn't open it? Maybe you could not open it. I will let you guys watch the video. We have it in the video. Awesome. So Sherwin any pain? No pain. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? What do you think actually working on him after 3 days of training? It was so easy. Yeah 3 days of training. Just 3 days. I thought you have to dig more. But you're doing just. Yeah. You were simple. Wow. Yeah awesome. No pain. Zero pain. 4 inches of motion. Can you go slower? Okay let me try again and squeeze. Because this is my problem with squeezing and opening jars. I cannot open it without pain. No more. Beautiful awesome. So what do you guys think? Great. How many minutes? How many minutes? You did a great job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What was that? Trigger finger. 5 minutes. Trigger finger. 5 minutes. No break. Alright awesome. You guys did a great job. Wow. Yeah great job.

I am a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR. We have now Dr. Gary and he is going to work on Sherwin. He just had ASTR class training and we will see how he is going to do his evaluation and treatment so go ahead. Okay start with where your pain is. Show me. And open. Okay. So let's get a brief history how long this has been going on. How like what's going on. So you have two years of trigger finger. Did you have an injury or? I cannot think of any. Okay. Working nursing home lifting but last year I cannot think of any incident where I injured it. Maybe from work but. So this has been going on for two years. What kind of treatment you had in the last two years? I have had myself, I thought I could get rid of it with exercise. You still have it. Did you have like physical therapy, massage, anything? Okay. I do my own treatment. You are a physical therapist. Yeah. So you have been doing your treatment. Like massage it and you did exercises on it but you still have it. It's getting better but it's still there when I wake up. How much pain now from zero to ten? It's about three. Three. At worse how much pain? In the morning it's still about seven or eight. Okay let's aggravate it now and get the symptoms before and let me see it in the camera here. Okay and open it. You definitely can see the trigger finger. Like it's stuck. Okay so we're going to do the treatment. Dr. Gary is going to work on your finger and then we'll test it again. Okay. Turn it up. Where's the pain right now? In this joint? Okay. Can it open up? Open it up. Okay. So you got some restrictions on the pain. Not pain. Okay. So guys you guys tell us about yourself while you're here. So Sherwin how long have you been practicing? I've been here practicing in California for about 15 years. As a physical therapist? Physical therapist. Okay. So who do you work with? Outpatient? I work in a skilled nursing facility. Mostly geriatric population. I've been in home health for the last three years. But a little tender. Okay. So Gary why are you working? Tell us about yourself. I've been a chiropractor for 14 years and I do home health now. And I was a physical therapy assistant for 15 years before that. So I was the oldest guy in my chiropractic class. So what? Mostly focused on soft tissue work. Didn't do a whole lot of adjusting. So what do you think about the ASTR class? You had three days of class so do you feel you're ready to work on patients? Pretty much yes. It seems to be a lot more efficient. Feel that loosen up? It's moving so much better. That really feels good. Alright. Let us know if you feel any pain okay? Just don't scream in the kitchen. That one is really restricted. You really have a bad case of trigger finger by the way. This is severe. Like I did when I was in high school. 12 So let's use the instrument and we'll. Okay. It doesn't move. It doesn't move. Do you feel you have more grip with the instrument? Easier? Yeah. In some parts. Bigger. There he is. Do you feel that difference? Mm hm. No more. And it's interesting to feel the different areas have different directions of resistance. That's correct. Is it easier to feel it with your hand or the instrument? No it's pretty easy with the instrument. It makes it easier for you? Mm hm. Easier than I thought it would be. Less pain with my hand?

Trigger finger is a condition where the involved finger will catch as it bends. The finger is straightened with a pop or a snap. The flexor tendon becomes thick and irritated as it slides through the tendon pulley causing a thickened nodule and triggering of the tendon. There is no smooth gliding of the tendon. Repetitive injuries or occupation are risk factors for the development of trigger fingers. Symptoms. In trigger finger the pain will be at the level of the A1 pulley. It will be catching and clicking and triggering with finger flexion and extension. Pain before triggering, the pain is usually not well localized and non-specific. The patient will complain of catching, the unlocking that is fixed and these are the typical stages of trigger finger. The locking can occur when the tendon is unable to pass through the sheath. As the tendon becomes inflamed it gets caught. The condition is progressive and it may lead to a flexed finger. It commonly affects the ring and long fingers. It is an A1 pulley problem. Here is the arrangement of the pulley system and here you can find the location of the A1 pulley which causes the symptoms. So you will find the tenderness at the A1 pulley. 60% or more of patients with trigger fingers usually have associated Carpal Tannen Syndrome. It occurs more in diabetics and more in females older than 50 years old. In diabetics both hands may be affected and multiple digits in the hand can be affected. Diabetics patients have a better prognosis. Diabetes is a poor prognostic indicator for non-operative treatment and these patients are prone to develop stiffness or recurrence of the condition after surgical release. In addition to diabetes there are some other medical conditions that can be associated with trigger fingers such as gout, pseudo gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Cercoidosis, Hypotheridism. Treatment of trigger finger. Conservative treatment, the most important prognostic indicator for a good result with non-operative treatment is the duration of triggering before coming to the doctor. An irreducible locked trigger finger with flexion contracture of the PIP joint should not be treated conservatively or even by injection. It will need surgery. Conservative treatment with splinting, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, rest and modifying activity. It will give some relief to the patients. Injection, inject into the sheath not into the tendon. 60 to 80% of non-diabetic patients may get better with injection. Watch the dose of the steroid that is given in diabetic patients. Injection is not very effective in diabetic patients. Also try to obtain hemoglobin A1c in these patients before considering injection or any surgical intervention. The injection can be repeated up to three times. The majority of the patients get better with injection or surgery. What is the technique of injection? Injection into the flexor tendon sheath may provide relief for triggering of the finger. The neurovascular bundle is on the side of the tendon and the poly. After the site is marked, use a 25 gauge needle. Advance the needle through the midline down to the bone. Pull the needle back slightly and inject the medication freely. Inject the medication into the sheath or into the poly freely. Surgery is done if the non-operative treatment fails and that will include release of the A1 poly. There is a higher recurrence in diabetic patients with surgery. The release of A1 poly can be percutaneous or it can be open. Percutaneous release of A1 poly can be done for the fingers but not for the thumb because the radial digital nerve almost crosses in the middle of the surgical field and it can be injured. When releasing the A1 poly, the release should be done at the level of the MP joint. The A2 and A4 polys are important structures and should not be touched, excised or released. Only A1 poly is cut and released and the flexor tendon is released. Surgical release. How do you release the A1 poly? The procedure is done with local anesthesia to allow intraoperative assessment and to communicate with the patient to confirm that adequate release was done. Here there is a surgical case. The incision is marked out in the palmar crease for surgical division of the A1 poly. Notice that the correct fingers are marked before surgery and the fingers are usually marked on the palmar aspect and the dorsal aspect. The A1 poly is exposed and released. Notice the patient also had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which is frequently associated with the condition of trigger finger. You can see the tendon over the hemostat appears released. The patient is asked to move the fingers to confirm the success of the procedure. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, patients may need excision of the slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis. How about trigger thumb? This is the incision for the surgical release of trigger thumb. The incision for trigger thumb is placed in the MP flexion crease. When releasing the flexor pollicis longus tendon, watch out for the digital radion nerve. It's in the field of surgery. Thank you very much. I hope that was helpful. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Notice the patient also had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which is frequently associated with the condition of trigger finger. You can see the tendon over the hemostat appears released. The patient is asked to move the fingers to confirm the success of the procedure. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, patients may need excision of the slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis.

Trigger finger is a condition where the involved finger will catch as it bends. The finger is straightened with a pop or a snap. The flexor tendon becomes thick and irritated as it slides through the tendon pulley causing a thickened nodule and triggering of the tendon. There is no smooth gliding of the tendon. Repetitive injuries or occupation are risk factors for the development of trigger fingers. Symptoms. In trigger finger the pain will be at the level of the A1 pulley. It will be catching and clicking and triggering with finger flexion and extension. Pain before triggering, the pain is usually not well localized and non-specific. The patient will complain of catching, the unlocking that is fixed and these are the typical stages of trigger finger. The locking can occur when the tendon is unable to pass through the sheath. As the tendon becomes inflamed it gets caught. The condition is progressive and it may lead to a flexed finger. It commonly affects the ring and long fingers. It is an A1 pulley problem. Here is the arrangement of the pulley system and here you can find the location of the A1 pulley which causes the symptoms. So you will find the tenderness at the A1 pulley. 60% or more of patients with trigger fingers usually have associated Carpal Tannen Syndrome. It occurs more in diabetics and more in females older than 50 years old. In diabetics both hands may be affected and multiple digits in the hand can be affected. Diabetics patients have a better prognosis. Diabetes is a poor prognostic indicator for non-operative treatment and these patients are prone to develop stiffness or recurrence of the condition after surgical release. In addition to diabetes there are some other medical conditions that can be associated with trigger fingers such as gout, pseudo gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Cercoidosis, Hypotheridism. Treatment of trigger finger. Conservative treatment, the most important prognostic indicator for a good result with non-operative treatment is the duration of triggering before coming to the doctor. An irreducible locked trigger finger with flexion contracture of the PIP joint should not be treated conservatively or even by injection. It will need surgery. Conservative treatment with splinting, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, rest and modifying activity. It will give some relief to the patients. Injection, inject into the sheath not into the tendon. 60 to 80% of non-diabetic patients may get better with injection. Watch the dose of the steroid that is given in diabetic patients. Injection is not very effective in diabetic patients. Also try to obtain hemoglobin A1c in these patients before considering injection or any surgical intervention. The injection can be repeated up to three times. The majority of the patients get better with injection or surgery. What is the technique of injection? Injection into the flexor tendon sheath may provide relief for triggering of the finger. The neurovascular bundle is on the side of the tendon and the poly. After the site is marked, use a 25 gauge needle. Advance the needle through the midline down to the bone. Pull the needle back slightly and inject the medication freely. Inject the medication into the sheath or into the poly freely. Surgery is done if the non-operative treatment fails and that will include release of the A1 poly. There is a higher recurrence in diabetic patients with surgery. The release of A1 poly can be percutaneous or it can be open. Percutaneous release of A1 poly can be done for the fingers but not for the thumb because the radial digital nerve almost crosses in the middle of the surgical field and it can be injured.

Notice that the correct fingers are marked before surgery and the fingers are usually marked on the palmar aspect and the dorsal aspect. The A1 poly is exposed and released. Notice the patient also had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which is frequently associated with the condition of trigger finger. You can see the tendon over the hemostat appears released. The patient is asked to move the fingers to confirm the success of the procedure. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, patients may need excision of the slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis. How about trigger thumb? This is the incision for the surgical release of trigger thumb. The incision for trigger thumb is placed in the MP flexion crease.

Trigger finger is a condition where the involved finger will catch as it bends. The finger is straightened with a pop or a snap. The flexor tendon becomes thick and irritated as it slides through the tendon pulley causing a thickened nodule and triggering of the tendon. There is no smooth gliding of the tendon. Repetitive injuries or occupation are risk factors for the development of trigger fingers. Symptoms. In trigger finger the pain will be at the level of the A1 pulley. It will be catching and clicking and triggering with finger flexion and extension. Pain before triggering, the pain is usually not well localized and non-specific. The patient will complain of catching, the unlocking that is fixed and these are the typical stages of trigger finger. The locking can occur when the tendon is unable to pass through the sheath. As the tendon becomes inflamed it gets caught. The condition is progressive and it may lead to a flexed finger. It commonly affects the ring and long fingers. It is an A1 pulley problem. Here is the arrangement of the pulley system and here you can find the location of the A1 pulley which causes the symptoms. So you will find the tenderness at the A1 pulley. 60% or more of patients with trigger fingers usually have associated Carpal Tannen Syndrome. It occurs more in diabetics and more in females older than 50 years old. In diabetics both hands may be affected and multiple digits in the hand can be affected. Diabetics patients have a better prognosis. Diabetes is a poor prognostic indicator for non-operative treatment and these patients are prone to develop stiffness or recurrence of the condition after surgical release. In addition to diabetes there are some other medical conditions that can be associated with trigger fingers such as gout, pseudo gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Cercoidosis, Hypotheridism. Treatment of trigger finger. Conservative treatment, the most important prognostic indicator for a good result with non-operative treatment is the duration of triggering before coming to the doctor. An irreducible locked trigger finger with flexion contracture of the PIP joint should not be treated conservatively or even by injection. It will need surgery. Conservative treatment with splinting, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, rest and modifying activity. It will give some relief to the patients. Injection, inject into the sheath not into the tendon. 60 to 80% of non-diabetic patients may get better with injection. Watch the dose of the steroid that is given in diabetic patients. Injection is not very effective in diabetic patients. Also try to obtain hemoglobin A1c in these patients before considering injection or any surgical intervention. The injection can be repeated up to three times. The majority of the patients get better with injection or surgery. What is the technique of injection? Injection into the flexor tendon sheath may provide relief for triggering of the finger. The neurovascular bundle is on the side of the tendon and the poly. After the site is marked, use a 25 gauge needle. Advance the needle through the midline down to the bone. Pull the needle back slightly and inject the medication freely. Inject the medication into the sheath or into the poly freely. Surgery is done if the non-operative treatment fails and that will include release of the A1 poly. There is a higher recurrence in diabetic patients with surgery. The release of A1 poly can be percutaneous or it can be open. Percutaneous release of A1 poly can be done for the fingers but not for the thumb because the radial digital nerve almost crosses in the middle of the surgical field and it can be injured. When releasing the A1 poly, the release should be done at the level of the MP joint. The A2 and A4 polys are important structures and should not be touched, excised or released. Only A1 poly is cut and released and the flexor tendon is released. Surgical release. How do you release the A1 poly?

So today we'll be talking about trigger finger also called stenosyptinosynovitis. A patient will present with one of their fingers locked in this position. This happens and occurs because the A1 pulley or the flexor tendon sheath, there's edema and fibrosis in this area causing the tendon to be trapped under the A1 pulley and they're unable to extend the thumb completely. It'll flex down but they cannot extend it. Now this can occur with any of the fingers. Why people develop trigger finger, no one knows why exactly. However, we do find to be fairly common in people who have diabetes and sometimes it can present after someone has a carpal tunnel release for some unknown reason but it does happen. Now how do we prevent it? I want to show you some exercise that I found to be fairly effective in my practice. So let's start with the thumb again. If the thumb is effective and locks down like this and they're unable to extend the thumb, I recommend that they start with light massage directly over this area. This is the area of the A1 pulley. For each finger there's a pulley. This is the A1 pulley in this area. To massage over this area and to bring the thumb, if the thumb is affected, up and down and to make a fist, up and down. I recommend doing this approximately three times a day for about two minutes. Very easy exercise to do, not difficult at all. Now let's talk about treatment modalities for trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. First we start with anti-inflammatory medication. Next, physical therapy. If those modalities don't help, acupuncture. If that doesn't help, the next thing we can consider would be an injection to the finger with a steroid. In my practice I use Kenalog and Markane. Both of these work very effective. The Kenalog is a steroid and the Markane is the analgesic. So with that said, if the steroid injection is not effective, then the last treatment modality would be surgical intervention which would be release of the A1 pulley. It's a very, very effective surgical procedure. It takes approximately three to five minutes to do properly and it's quite effective for most patients. Let's talk about some lifestyle change that you may want to consider if you have trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. Exercise every day. Stay healthy. Drink more water. Eat more fruits, nuts, vegetables and grains. Of course, attempt to do those stretching exercises that I showed you at least two or three times a day. These are things that I think can help you on your journey if you have and if you develop trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

However, we do find to be fairly common in people who have diabetes and sometimes it can present after someone has a carpal tunnel release for some unknown reason but it does happen. Now how do we prevent it? I want to show you some exercise that I found to be fairly effective in my practice. So let's start with the thumb again. If the thumb is effective and locks down like this and they're unable to extend the thumb, I recommend that they start with light massage directly over this area. This is the area of the A1 pulley. For each finger there's a pulley. This is the A1 pulley in this area. To massage over this area and to bring the thumb, if the thumb is affected, up and down and to make a fist, up and down. I recommend doing this approximately three times a day for about two minutes. Very easy exercise to do, not difficult at all. Now let's talk about treatment modalities for trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. First we start with anti-inflammatory medication. Next, physical therapy. If those modalities don't help, acupuncture. If that doesn't help, the next thing we can consider would be an injection to the finger with a steroid. In my practice I use Kenalog and Markane. Both of these work very effective. The Kenalog is a steroid and the Markane is the analgesic. So with that said, if the steroid injection is not effective, then the last treatment modality would be surgical intervention which would be release of the A1 pulley. It's a very, very effective surgical procedure. It takes approximately three to five minutes to do properly and it's quite effective for most patients. Let's talk about some lifestyle change that you may want to consider if you have trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. Exercise every day. Stay healthy. Drink more water. Eat more fruits, nuts, vegetables and grains. Of course, attempt to do those stretching exercises that I showed you at least two or three times a day. These are things that I think can help you on your journey if you have and if you develop trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

So today we'll be talking about trigger finger also called stenosyptinosynovitis. A patient will present with one of their fingers locked in this position. This happens and occurs because the A1 pulley or the flexor tendon sheath, there's edema and fibrosis in this area causing the tendon to be trapped under the A1 pulley and they're unable to extend the thumb completely. It'll flex down but they cannot extend it. Now this can occur with any of the fingers. Why people develop trigger finger, no one knows why exactly. However, we do find to be fairly common in people who have diabetes and sometimes it can present after someone has a carpal tunnel release for some unknown reason but it does happen. Now how do we prevent it? I want to show you some exercise that I found to be fairly effective in my practice. So let's start with the thumb again. If the thumb is effective and locks down like this and they're unable to extend the thumb, I recommend that they start with light massage directly over this area. This is the area of the A1 pulley. For each finger there's a pulley. This is the A1 pulley in this area. To massage over this area and to bring the thumb, if the thumb is affected, up and down and to make a fist, up and down. I recommend doing this approximately three times a day for about two minutes. Very easy exercise to do, not difficult at all. Now let's talk about treatment modalities for trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. First we start with anti-inflammatory medication. Next, physical therapy. If those modalities don't help, acupuncture. If that doesn't help, the next thing we can consider would be an injection to the finger with a steroid. In my practice I use Kenalog and Markane.

First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little ridge structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. And once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and then it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric artery. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which averts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. Usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little ridge structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. And once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and then it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric artery. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which averts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. Usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little ridge structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. And once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and then it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric artery. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which averts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on.
