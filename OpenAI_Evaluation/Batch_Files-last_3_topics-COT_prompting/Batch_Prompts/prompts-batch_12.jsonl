I'm a neurologist practicing out of MP Heart Clinic in GK1 and Metro hospitals in Noida. And today we're going to talk about, you know, a different type of a headache called cluster headaches. Believe it or not, cluster headaches are actually one of the most painful conditions a person can go through. It's almost like having a knife in your eye. And that is the key feature actually of a cluster headache. So if somebody has excruciating pain right in their eye, lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, possibly that could be a cluster headache. Apart from that, you would also have features like watering in your eye, runny nose, redness in your eye. And this headache is so bad that instead of lying down still, people who actually have it are really restless. So what can you do for it? Well, foremost, definitely speak to your doctor. Since there are techniques and medications that you can do that can definitely reduce the pain at that time. What you need to do is, of course, take the right medication in time that will help reduce the pain.

It is characterized by the inability to straighten a finger from a flexed position. It occurs due to tenosynovitis caused by inflammation of the tendon sheath surrounding the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis. The swelling and inflammation prevents the tendon from gliding smoothly through the sheath and thus the finger gets stuck in a bent position and then snaps back into place. Treatment for this condition involves releasing the swollen A1 pulley sheath surrounding the tendons.

And what happens is the tendon typically has to glide in the palm through a series of ligaments, or almost like tunnels, which we refer to medically as pulleys. And with the inflammation that comes with the tendonitis, the tendon swells, and every time it tries to glide into these little tunnels, it gets trapped and the motion of moving your finger, it kind of goes click-clunk rather than having a nice smooth motion. It can be quite tender, quite uncomfortable. And sometimes, the parts that are inflamed actually get trapped in a bent position, so it's hard to straighten your finger unless you take your other hand and work on straightening it. So trigger fingers should be treated when it's interfering with your quality of life. So, if you are finding it's annoying because you go to, you know, if you go to hold a glass and your finger kind of gets stuck and you can't let go, or you hold something smaller like a pot and you can't put it down because the finger is stuck in a bent position. More commonly, people come because it's sore, and the soreness is what they're looking for treatment of, not so much the actual locking. A treatment for trigger finger, you can try conservative management with taking Motrin, Advil. Occasionally, we'll have people try splinting the finger straight. People report that in the morning, they'll often wake up with their finger bent. And so, we find if they sleep with the finger straight at night, the tendon is not as likely to get caught. But this doesn't have a very high success rate. Then the options that we have are injecting, injecting and trying to do a procedure through the skin with a needle or doing surgery. The principles of these different treatments, our number one is to try to control the inflammation around the tendon. And number two is to make more space for the tendon to glide. So with the cortisone injection, that's direct, trying to control the amount of inflammation in the tendon, which then usually allows it to glide more smoothly. When we do what's called the percutaneous approach through the skin with a needle, we're injecting cortisone to control the inflammation, but also, we're trying to cut with the edge of the needle to open up the tunnel a little bit. This we can only offer for certain fingers, usually the middle two fingers, your middle and your ring finger. Other fingers, it's a little bit trickier, a little bit more dangerous because of nerves that are there. When we do the surgery, the goal is simply to open the tunnel where the tendon is most likely trapped and give it free rein to glide without getting trapped. Recurrence following treatment, if you go the injection route, then we find that with one injection we can cure about 70% of people. So there'll be some people who will come back. We can offer them a second injection. With that second injection, that cures about 50% of people second time around. That gives us an overall cure rate of 85% with the injection approach. If we go the surgery approach, the cure rate is closer to 99, you know, .5%. In terms of risk, with the surgery, we're opening the skin. There's certainly a slightly greater chance of infection with that approach than with the injection. But, I mean, the risk of infection with this type of an elective procedure is pretty small. So that shouldn't be the main deterrent. With the surgery, your recovery time is a little longer. You have some soreness in your palm, can't get your hand wet. So there's definitely some downtime. In terms of frequency, I would see, easily, you know, 10 to 15 trigger fingers a month that end up choosing the injection route against maybe one or possibly two that would choose the surgery route. The decision about what to do is the patient's decision, and I think that's one of the things that we pride ourselves here at Dartmouth is that we very much will have a good discussion and let people know what the different treatments are, what the, maybe the cost differences are, what the differences are in complications in recovery and success rate, and help people to make the decision that's best for them, given their demands in life, their preferences and their values, and make a decision that way.

And what happens is the tendon typically has to glide in the palm through a series of ligaments, or almost like tunnels, which we refer to medically as pulleys. And with the inflammation that comes with the tendonitis, the tendon swells, and every time it tries to glide into these little tunnels, it gets trapped and the motion of moving your finger, it kind of goes click-clunk rather than having a nice smooth motion. It can be quite tender, quite uncomfortable. And sometimes, the parts that are inflamed actually get trapped in a bent position, so it's hard to straighten your finger unless you take your other hand and work on straightening it. So trigger fingers should be treated when it's interfering with your quality of life. So, if you are finding it's annoying because you go to, you know, if you go to hold a glass and your finger kind of gets stuck and you can't let go, or you hold something smaller like a pot and you can't put it down because the finger is stuck in a bent position. More commonly, people come because it's sore, and the soreness is what they're looking for treatment of, not so much the actual locking. A treatment for trigger finger, you can try conservative management with taking Motrin, Advil. Occasionally, we'll have people try splinting the finger straight. People report that in the morning, they'll often wake up with their finger bent. And so, we find if they sleep with the finger straight at night, the tendon is not as likely to get caught. But this doesn't have a very high success rate. Then the options that we have are injecting, injecting and trying to do a procedure through the skin with a needle or doing surgery. The principles of these different treatments, our number one is to try to control the inflammation around the tendon. And number two is to make more space for the tendon to glide. So with the cortisone injection, that's direct, trying to control the amount of inflammation in the tendon, which then usually allows it to glide more smoothly. When we do what's called the percutaneous approach through the skin with a needle, we're injecting cortisone to control the inflammation, but also, we're trying to cut with the edge of the needle to open up the tunnel a little bit. This we can only offer for certain fingers, usually the middle two fingers, your middle and your ring finger. Other fingers, it's a little bit trickier, a little bit more dangerous because of nerves that are there. When we do the surgery, the goal is simply to open the tunnel where the tendon is most likely trapped and give it free rein to glide without getting trapped. Recurrence following treatment, if you go the injection route, then we find that with one injection we can cure about 70% of people. So there'll be some people who will come back. We can offer them a second injection. With that second injection, that cures about 50% of people second time around. That gives us an overall cure rate of 85% with the injection approach. If we go the surgery approach, the cure rate is closer to 99, you know, .5%. In terms of risk, with the surgery, we're opening the skin. There's certainly a slightly greater chance of infection with that approach than with the injection. But, I mean, the risk of infection with this type of an elective procedure is pretty small. So that shouldn't be the main deterrent. With the surgery, your recovery time is a little longer. You have some soreness in your palm, can't get your hand wet. So there's definitely some downtime. In terms of frequency, I would see, easily, you know, 10 to 15 trigger fingers a month that end up choosing the injection route against maybe one or possibly two that would choose the surgery route. The decision about what to do is the patient's decision, and I think that's one of the things that we pride ourselves here at Dartmouth is that we very much will have a good discussion and let people know what the different treatments are, what the, maybe the cost differences are, what the differences are in complications in recovery and success rate, and help people to make the decision that's best for them, given their demands in life, their preferences and their values, and make a decision that way.

But this doesn't have a very high success rate. Then the options that we have are injecting, injecting and trying to do a procedure through the skin with a needle or doing surgery. The principles of these different treatments, our number one is to try to control the inflammation around the tendon. And number two is to make more space for the tendon to glide. So with the cortisone injection, that's direct, trying to control the amount of inflammation in the tendon, which then usually allows it to glide more smoothly. When we do what's called the percutaneous approach through the skin with a needle, we're injecting cortisone to control the inflammation, but also, we're trying to cut with the edge of the needle to open up the tunnel a little bit. This we can only offer for certain fingers, usually the middle two fingers, your middle and your ring finger. Other fingers, it's a little bit trickier, a little bit more dangerous because of nerves that are there. When we do the surgery, the goal is simply to open the tunnel where the tendon is most likely trapped and give it free rein to glide without getting trapped. Recurrence following treatment, if you go the injection route, then we find that with one injection we can cure about 70% of people. So there'll be some people who will come back. We can offer them a second injection. With that second injection, that cures about 50% of people second time around. That gives us an overall cure rate of 85% with the injection approach. If we go the surgery approach, the cure rate is closer to 99, you know, .5%. In terms of risk, with the surgery, we're opening the skin. There's certainly a slightly greater chance of infection with that approach than with the injection. But, I mean, the risk of infection with this type of an elective procedure is pretty small. So that shouldn't be the main deterrent. With the surgery, your recovery time is a little longer. You have some soreness in your palm, can't get your hand wet. So there's definitely some downtime. In terms of frequency, I would see, easily, you know, 10 to 15 trigger fingers a month that end up choosing the injection route against maybe one or possibly two that would choose the surgery route. The decision about what to do is the patient's decision, and I think that's one of the things that we pride ourselves here at Dartmouth is that we very much will have a good discussion and let people know what the different treatments are, what the, maybe the cost differences are, what the differences are in complications in recovery and success rate, and help people to make the decision that's best for them, given their demands in life, their preferences and their values, and make a decision that way.

And what happens is the tendon typically has to glide in the palm through a series of ligaments, or almost like tunnels, which we refer to medically as pulleys. And with the inflammation that comes with the tendonitis, the tendon swells, and every time it tries to glide into these little tunnels, it gets trapped and the motion of moving your finger, it kind of goes click-clunk rather than having a nice smooth motion. It can be quite tender, quite uncomfortable. And sometimes, the parts that are inflamed actually get trapped in a bent position, so it's hard to straighten your finger unless you take your other hand and work on straightening it. So trigger fingers should be treated when it's interfering with your quality of life. So, if you are finding it's annoying because you go to, you know, if you go to hold a glass and your finger kind of gets stuck and you can't let go, or you hold something smaller like a pot and you can't put it down because the finger is stuck in a bent position.

Long cord-like structures called tendons connect these muscles to the bones in your fingers and thumb. A tunnel of tissue called a tendon sheath surrounds each tendon. This allows the tendon to glide smoothly as the fingers move. The sheath is held in place by bands of tissue called pulleys. They hold the tendon close to the bone for optimal functioning of the tendon. When your flexor muscles contract, the pulleys help guide the tendons to flex or bend your fingers. Normally, the tendons glide smoothly through the pulleys when the fingers flex and extend. Trigger finger, also known as trigger thumb, or stenosing tenosynovitis, is a condition where the pulley at the base of your finger becomes inflamed and swollen. This makes it harder for the tendon to move through the pulley. Over time, the tendon may also swell and form a bump near the pulley. When you bend your finger, the swollen area on the tendon may cause a catching or triggering sensation as it initially gets hung on the pulley and then slips underneath. If not treated, the tendon may swell enough that it cannot pass beneath the pulley. As a result, your finger may get stuck in a bent position. If you have trigger finger, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: a tender lump on your palm at the base of your finger. A catching, popping or locking sensation when you move your finger. And pain when you bend or straighten your finger. The cause of trigger finger isn't known but some conditions that can increase your risk for it include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and repeated injuries, forceful and repetitive hand gripping may also increase your risk. To treat mild trigger finger, your doctor may advise you to rest your hand and avoid activities that make it worse. Your doctor may prescribe antiinflammatory medication or a corticosteroid injection to reduce the swelling. You may also need to wear a finger splint to keep your finger straight. If non-surgical treatments haven't worked, your doctor may advise you to have a surgical procedure. To start the procedure, your surgeon will make a small incision in your palm. Then the pulley will be cut to free the tendon. At the end of the procedure, your incision may be closed with stitches and covered with a soft bandage.
