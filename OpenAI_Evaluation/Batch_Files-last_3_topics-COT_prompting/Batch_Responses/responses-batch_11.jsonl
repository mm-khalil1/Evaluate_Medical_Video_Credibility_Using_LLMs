Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Consultations with Doctors**: Helga frequently consults with Dr. Silva, discussing various treatment options. The discussions about nerve block injections, potential risks, the use of prescription drugs, and the symptoms she experiences after treatments indicate active involvement in her treatment plan.\n\n2. **Monitoring Symptoms**: The suggestion to keep a diary to track headache patterns encourages patient involvement and shared decision-making, as it provides valuable information that could influence treatment choices.\n\n3. **Risk Discussions**: The video summarizes conversations where Dr. Silva explains the potential side effects of treatments like steroids and the off-label use of medications, thus preparing Helga for what to expect and involving her in weighing the pros and cons.\n\nHowever, the video lacks broader perspectives from family members or the input of other healthcare professionals beyond Dr. Silva. There are no explicit suggestions for Helga to involve her family more in decision-making, no encouragement to seek second opinions, and no mention of support from other healthcare providers such as nurses or headache specialists.\n\nIn summary, while the video supports shared decision-making"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1274, "completion_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 1524}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_729ea513f7"}}, "error": null}
