This video will show you how to, one, use the different types of insulin pens, two, choose a good injection site, three, prepare for an injection and choose the right pen needle, and four, do the injection. There are several different types of insulin pens. Some insulin pens are disposable, with the insulin already in the pen. There is a plunger in the pen. Once it is at the end of the pen, you will need to use a new pen. Once the pen is empty, you can throw the whole pen in your recycle bin. Nondisposable insulin pens. Some insulin pens are nondisposable. They have a reusable pen which holds an insulin cartridge that is inserted into the pen. To open and replace the insulin cartridge, some of the nondisposable pens twist, with the two parts of the pen moving in opposite directions. Other pens unscrew. The insulin cartridge is put into the pen with the smaller end going in first. Nondisposable pens also have a plunger. Once the plunger is at the end of the insulin cartridge, you must replace the cartridge in the pen. Caring for your insulin pen and cartridge. Once you start using a disposable insulin pen or a pen with the insulin cartridge, keep them at room temperature. Insulin is only good for 28 days at room temperature. If you have not used all the insulin at the end of the 28 days, throw the remainder away and use a new pen or cartridge. Insulin pens or cartridges that you are not using should be kept in the refrigerator until you need them or until they expire. Check the box they come in for the expiry date. All insulin pen or cartridges hold a minimum of 300 units of insulin, allowing for multiple doses. The pen dials up units of insulin. The way to dial up the dose is by twisting the knob at the end of the pen. For the Novo nondisposable pens, you need to pull out the end before dialing. Choosing a good injection site. For adults, the abdomen is the best place to do the injection because the insulin is absorbed the same each time. Other possible sites are the thighs and buttocks. The arm is not recommended because it is very easy to inject in the muscle. To inject in the abdomen, do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of your belly button. There are a lot of blood vessels in this area. Do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of any bones like your hip or ribs. Do not inject into scar tissue from injuries or surgeries. Do not inject where there are bumps or lumps from lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy is damaged tissue that happens when insulin has been injected into the same area many times. Scar tissue occurs under the skin with decreased blood flow to the area. Decreased blood flow means that if you inject in this area, the insulin will not be absorbed and will not work as good as it should. Avoid these areas for at least 3 months. To prevent lipohypertrophy, do not inject in the same area. Keep moving your injection sites over by one finger width. Keep rotating to different areas. If you move to a new injection area, be careful of low blood sugars as your insulin may now absorb faster and work better. Preparing for Injection To prepare for an injection, you will need your insulin pen and a pen needle. Choose the right needle. The pen needle should be 4 to 6 mm needle. You will find the size of the needle on the tear off tab on the pen needle. Use a new needle each time you inject. Next wash your hands. Before preparing for or doing the injection to reduce your chance of getting an infection, pull the cap off the pen and check to make sure there is enough insulin. Check the insulin in the pen. The insulin in the pen or cartridge may be cloudy or clear. If it is a cloudy insulin, there are two types of insulin in the pen. The insulin must be mixed so that you get the right amount of insulin. To mix the insulin, roll the pen between your palms 10 times, then tip the pen 10 times. This should be done before every injection. Pull the tab off the pen needle and attach it to the pen by twisting the needle clockwise until it is tight. Remove the two caps from the needle. Dial up 2 units. Push the bottom of the pen to release the air from the needle. Look for a drop of the insulin on the end of the needle. If there is no insulin, dial up another 2 units and push the bottom again. Repeat these steps until you see insulin at the end of the needle. Dial up the dose of insulin you will inject. Doing the injection. First put the needle in your skin straight in, not at an angle. If you are very thin, you might need to pinch your skin and lift it up to prevent the injection from going into the muscle. Inject the insulin by pushing the button at the bottom of the pen all the way in. Check to make sure the dial goes to zero. Count to 10. While leaving the needle in place so that you will get all of the insulin, you will know if you didn't leave the needle in long enough if your skin is wet or you smell insulin. Remove the needle from your skin. Recap the needle using the larger outer cap. Turn it to the left to remove the needle. Throw the needle in a sharps container or glass container with a lid. Never put the needle into your regular garbage. Do not store the pen with the needle attached as air can be pulled into the pen if the room temperature changes."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

This video will show you how to, one, use the different types of insulin pens, two, choose a good injection site, three, prepare for an injection and choose the right pen needle, and four, do the injection. There are several different types of insulin pens. Some insulin pens are disposable, with the insulin already in the pen. There is a plunger in the pen. Once it is at the end of the pen, you will need to use a new pen. Once the pen is empty, you can throw the whole pen in your recycle bin. Nondisposable insulin pens. Some insulin pens are nondisposable. They have a reusable pen which holds an insulin cartridge that is inserted into the pen. To open and replace the insulin cartridge, some of the nondisposable pens twist, with the two parts of the pen moving in opposite directions. Other pens unscrew. The insulin cartridge is put into the pen with the smaller end going in first. Nondisposable pens also have a plunger. Once the plunger is at the end of the insulin cartridge, you must replace the cartridge in the pen. Caring for your insulin pen and cartridge. Once you start using a disposable insulin pen or a pen with the insulin cartridge, keep them at room temperature. Insulin is only good for 28 days at room temperature. If you have not used all the insulin at the end of the 28 days, throw the remainder away and use a new pen or cartridge. Insulin pens or cartridges that you are not using should be kept in the refrigerator until you need them or until they expire. Check the box they come in for the expiry date. All insulin pen or cartridges hold a minimum of 300 units of insulin, allowing for multiple doses. The pen dials up units of insulin. The way to dial up the dose is by twisting the knob at the end of the pen. For the Novo nondisposable pens, you need to pull out the end before dialing. Choosing a good injection site. For adults, the abdomen is the best place to do the injection because the insulin is absorbed the same each time. Other possible sites are the thighs and buttocks. The arm is not recommended because it is very easy to inject in the muscle. To inject in the abdomen, do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of your belly button. There are a lot of blood vessels in this area. Do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of any bones like your hip or ribs. Do not inject into scar tissue from injuries or surgeries. Do not inject where there are bumps or lumps from lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy is damaged tissue that happens when insulin has been injected into the same area many times. Scar tissue occurs under the skin with decreased blood flow to the area. Decreased blood flow means that if you inject in this area, the insulin will not be absorbed and will not work as good as it should. Avoid these areas for at least 3 months. To prevent lipohypertrophy, do not inject in the same area. Keep moving your injection sites over by one finger width. Keep rotating to different areas. If you move to a new injection area, be careful of low blood sugars as your insulin may now absorb faster and work better. Preparing for Injection To prepare for an injection, you will need your insulin pen and a pen needle. Choose the right needle. The pen needle should be 4 to 6 mm needle. You will find the size of the needle on the tear off tab on the pen needle. Use a new needle each time you inject. Next wash your hands. Before preparing for or doing the injection to reduce your chance of getting an infection, pull the cap off the pen and check to make sure there is enough insulin. Check the insulin in the pen. The insulin in the pen or cartridge may be cloudy or clear. If it is a cloudy insulin, there are two types of insulin in the pen. The insulin must be mixed so that you get the right amount of insulin. To mix the insulin, roll the pen between your palms 10 times, then tip the pen 10 times. This should be done before every injection. Pull the tab off the pen needle and attach it to the pen by twisting the needle clockwise until it is tight. Remove the two caps from the needle. Dial up 2 units. Push the bottom of the pen to release the air from the needle. Look for a drop of the insulin on the end of the needle. If there is no insulin, dial up another 2 units and push the bottom again. Repeat these steps until you see insulin at the end of the needle. Dial up the dose of insulin you will inject. Doing the injection. First put the needle in your skin straight in, not at an angle. If you are very thin, you might need to pinch your skin and lift it up to prevent the injection from going into the muscle. Inject the insulin by pushing the button at the bottom of the pen all the way in. Check to make sure the dial goes to zero. Count to 10.

This should be done before every injection. Pull the tab off the pen needle and attach it to the pen by twisting the needle clockwise until it is tight. Remove the two caps from the needle. Dial up 2 units. Push the bottom of the pen to release the air from the needle. Look for a drop of the insulin on the end of the needle. If there is no insulin, dial up another 2 units and push the bottom again. Repeat these steps until you see insulin at the end of the needle. Dial up the dose of insulin you will inject. Doing the injection. First put the needle in your skin straight in, not at an angle. If you are very thin, you might need to pinch your skin and lift it up to prevent the injection from going into the muscle. Inject the insulin by pushing the button at the bottom of the pen all the way in. Check to make sure the dial goes to zero. Count to 10. While leaving the needle in place so that you will get all of the insulin, you will know if you didn't leave the needle in long enough if your skin is wet or you smell insulin. Remove the needle from your skin. Recap the needle using the larger outer cap. Turn it to the left to remove the needle. Throw the needle in a sharps container or glass container with a lid. Never put the needle into your regular garbage. Do not store the pen with the needle attached as air can be pulled into the pen if the room temperature changes."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

This video will show you how to, one, use the different types of insulin pens, two, choose a good injection site, three, prepare for an injection and choose the right pen needle, and four, do the injection. There are several different types of insulin pens. Some insulin pens are disposable, with the insulin already in the pen. There is a plunger in the pen. Once it is at the end of the pen, you will need to use a new pen. Once the pen is empty, you can throw the whole pen in your recycle bin. Nondisposable insulin pens. Some insulin pens are nondisposable. They have a reusable pen which holds an insulin cartridge that is inserted into the pen. To open and replace the insulin cartridge, some of the nondisposable pens twist, with the two parts of the pen moving in opposite directions. Other pens unscrew. The insulin cartridge is put into the pen with the smaller end going in first. Nondisposable pens also have a plunger. Once the plunger is at the end of the insulin cartridge, you must replace the cartridge in the pen. Caring for your insulin pen and cartridge. Once you start using a disposable insulin pen or a pen with the insulin cartridge, keep them at room temperature. Insulin is only good for 28 days at room temperature. If you have not used all the insulin at the end of the 28 days, throw the remainder away and use a new pen or cartridge. Insulin pens or cartridges that you are not using should be kept in the refrigerator until you need them or until they expire. Check the box they come in for the expiry date. All insulin pen or cartridges hold a minimum of 300 units of insulin, allowing for multiple doses. The pen dials up units of insulin. The way to dial up the dose is by twisting the knob at the end of the pen. For the Novo nondisposable pens, you need to pull out the end before dialing. Choosing a good injection site. For adults, the abdomen is the best place to do the injection because the insulin is absorbed the same each time. Other possible sites are the thighs and buttocks. The arm is not recommended because it is very easy to inject in the muscle. To inject in the abdomen, do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of your belly button. There are a lot of blood vessels in this area. Do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of any bones like your hip or ribs. Do not inject into scar tissue from injuries or surgeries. Do not inject where there are bumps or lumps from lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy is damaged tissue that happens when insulin has been injected into the same area many times. Scar tissue occurs under the skin with decreased blood flow to the area. Decreased blood flow means that if you inject in this area, the insulin will not be absorbed and will not work as good as it should. Avoid these areas for at least 3 months. To prevent lipohypertrophy, do not inject in the same area. Keep moving your injection sites over by one finger width. Keep rotating to different areas. If you move to a new injection area, be careful of low blood sugars as your insulin may now absorb faster and work better. Preparing for Injection To prepare for an injection, you will need your insulin pen and a pen needle. Choose the right needle. The pen needle should be 4 to 6 mm needle. You will find the size of the needle on the tear off tab on the pen needle. Use a new needle each time you inject. Next wash your hands. Before preparing for or doing the injection to reduce your chance of getting an infection, pull the cap off the pen and check to make sure there is enough insulin. Check the insulin in the pen. The insulin in the pen or cartridge may be cloudy or clear. If it is a cloudy insulin, there are two types of insulin in the pen.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi everybody, Nurse Scott here. How are you? Today's video is less of a vlog, like what's going on with me, and more of a how-to. The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery. Injecting yourself on a regular basis is pretty daunting, and it was to me too when I started needing to do that. So there are a couple of tricks to do this. I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner. So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi everybody, Nurse Scott here. How are you? Today's video is less of a vlog, like what's going on with me, and more of a how-to. The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery. Injecting yourself on a regular basis is pretty daunting, and it was to me too when I started needing to do that. So there are a couple of tricks to do this. I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner.

Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery. Injecting yourself on a regular basis is pretty daunting, and it was to me too when I started needing to do that. So there are a couple of tricks to do this. I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner. So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets.

It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi everybody, Nurse Scott here. How are you? Today's video is less of a vlog, like what's going on with me, and more of a how-to. The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery. Injecting yourself on a regular basis is pretty daunting, and it was to me too when I started needing to do that. So there are a couple of tricks to do this. I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner. So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner. So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery.

I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein.

In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

It's important to always wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds prior to giving an insulin injection. Insulin helps take the glucose in your blood and move it into your cells to provide energy. All patients with type 1 diabetes and many patients with type 2 diabetes need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Many patients need two different types of insulin. Basil or long-acting insulin is insulin given once or twice daily to control your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Basil insulin should be taken every day regardless of eating. Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. We'll start with how to give an injection with an insulin pen. First, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. Take the cap off your pen and wipe it clean with the second alcohol wipe. Take a new pen needle and peel off the paper backing. Twist the pen needle on your pen. Attach the pen needle immediately before you give an injection and do not store the insulin pen with a pen needle attached. The pen needle has two caps, an outer cap and an inner cap. Take off the clear outer cap and save it. Carefully take off the inner cap exposing the needle. Before every injection, you should prime the needle or give a test shot of insulin. Turn the pen dial to two units. Turn the pen so that the pen needle is pointed straight up. Press the button and you will see a spray or drops of insulin at the end of the pen needle. Priming the pen needle gets all the air out of the needle and ensures that the pen is working and dose is accurate. Now dial the pen to the dose prescribed by your doctor. You are ready to give the injection. If you are using a nano pen needle, there is no reason to pinch your skin. For all other length pen needles, gently pinch your skin where you are going to inject. Inject at a 90 degree angle into your skin. Push the pen button and watch the dial turn down to zero. Count to ten before removing the needle. Put the clear outer cap back on the pen needle and twist off to remove the needle. Never store your pen with a used needle attached. Put the cap back on the pen to keep it clean. All sharps should be disposed in a sharps container. You can make your own sharps container by using a hard plastic bottle like a laundry detergent or milk jug. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control or DHEC provides free stickers to place on your sharps bottle. When your sharps container is three-quarters full, it can be thrown away into the normal trash. DHEC will mail these stickers to your home for free or you can print them from their website."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. We'll start with how to give an injection with an insulin pen. First, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. Take the cap off your pen and wipe it clean with the second alcohol wipe. Take a new pen needle and peel off the paper backing. Twist the pen needle on your pen. Attach the pen needle immediately before you give an injection and do not store the insulin pen with a pen needle attached. The pen needle has two caps, an outer cap and an inner cap. Take off the clear outer cap and save it. Carefully take off the inner cap exposing the needle. Before every injection, you should prime the needle or give a test shot of insulin. Turn the pen dial to two units. Turn the pen so that the pen needle is pointed straight up. Press the button and you will see a spray or drops of insulin at the end of the pen needle. Priming the pen needle gets all the air out of the needle and ensures that the pen is working and dose is accurate. Now dial the pen to the dose prescribed by your doctor. You are ready to give the injection. If you are using a nano pen needle, there is no reason to pinch your skin. For all other length pen needles, gently pinch your skin where you are going to inject. Inject at a 90 degree angle into your skin. Push the pen button and watch the dial turn down to zero. Count to ten before removing the needle. Put the clear outer cap back on the pen needle and twist off to remove the needle. Never store your pen with a used needle attached. Put the cap back on the pen to keep it clean. All sharps should be disposed in a sharps container. You can make your own sharps container by using a hard plastic bottle like a laundry detergent or milk jug. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control or DHEC provides free stickers to place on your sharps bottle. When your sharps container is three-quarters full, it can be thrown away into the normal trash. DHEC will mail these stickers to your home for free or you can print them from their website."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

It's important to always wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds prior to giving an insulin injection. Insulin helps take the glucose in your blood and move it into your cells to provide energy. All patients with type 1 diabetes and many patients with type 2 diabetes need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Many patients need two different types of insulin. Basil or long-acting insulin is insulin given once or twice daily to control your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Basil insulin should be taken every day regardless of eating. Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. If you use an insulin vial, always clean the top of the vial with a new alcohol swab before each injection. Use a new syringe for each injection. Each syringe has two caps, an orange cap that protects the needle and a white cap to cover the syringe plunger. Both of these caps will be removed prior to using the syringe. To draw up your insulin dose, first draw air into the syringe equal to your dose of insulin. Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle. Push the air into the vial. Flip the vial over to withdraw insulin. Pull back on the plunger until you have the correct amount of insulin in your syringe. Be sure to measure at the top of the black plunger. If you have any air bubbles, push them back into the vial and pull out more insulin until your dose is correct. Air bubbles will not hurt you, but your dose will not be accurate. If using a syringe, hold the syringe like a dart and gently pinch your skin where you're going to inject. Inject at a 90-degree angle. Inject the insulin and count to 10 before removing the syringe. Throw the syringe directly into your sharps container. Never recap a syringe."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

It's important to always wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds prior to giving an insulin injection. Insulin helps take the glucose in your blood and move it into your cells to provide energy. All patients with type 1 diabetes and many patients with type 2 diabetes need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Many patients need two different types of insulin. Basil or long-acting insulin is insulin given once or twice daily to control your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Basil insulin should be taken every day regardless of eating. Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. If you use an insulin vial, always clean the top of the vial with a new alcohol swab before each injection. Use a new syringe for each injection. Each syringe has two caps, an orange cap that protects the needle and a white cap to cover the syringe plunger. Both of these caps will be removed prior to using the syringe. To draw up your insulin dose, first draw air into the syringe equal to your dose of insulin. Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle. Push the air into the vial. Flip the vial over to withdraw insulin. Pull back on the plunger until you have the correct amount of insulin in your syringe. Be sure to measure at the top of the black plunger. If you have any air bubbles, push them back into the vial and pull out more insulin until your dose is correct. Air bubbles will not hurt you, but your dose will not be accurate. If using a syringe, hold the syringe like a dart and gently pinch your skin where you're going to inject. Inject at a 90-degree angle. Inject the insulin and count to 10 before removing the syringe. Throw the syringe directly into your sharps container. Never recap a syringe."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

If you have any air bubbles, push them back into the vial and pull out more insulin until your dose is correct. Air bubbles will not hurt you, but your dose will not be accurate.

It's important to always wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds prior to giving an insulin injection. Insulin helps take the glucose in your blood and move it into your cells to provide energy. All patients with type 1 diabetes and many patients with type 2 diabetes need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Many patients need two different types of insulin. Basil or long-acting insulin is insulin given once or twice daily to control your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Basil insulin should be taken every day regardless of eating. Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. If you use an insulin vial, always clean the top of the vial with a new alcohol swab before each injection. Use a new syringe for each injection. Each syringe has two caps, an orange cap that protects the needle and a white cap to cover the syringe plunger. Both of these caps will be removed prior to using the syringe. To draw up your insulin dose, first draw air into the syringe equal to your dose of insulin. Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle. Push the air into the vial. Flip the vial over to withdraw insulin. Pull back on the plunger until you have the correct amount of insulin in your syringe. Be sure to measure at the top of the black plunger. If you have any air bubbles, push them back into the vial and pull out more insulin until your dose is correct. Air bubbles will not hurt you, but your dose will not be accurate. If using a syringe, hold the syringe like a dart and gently pinch your skin where you're going to inject. Inject at a 90-degree angle. Inject the insulin and count to 10 before removing the syringe. Throw the syringe directly into your sharps container. Never recap a syringe."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

There's a little tip there as well so it's doubly packaged. There's an extremely tiny needle. It's a 26 gauge needle. So small you can barely see it and as you might expect, virtually painless because it's so small. First of all, we're going to test the system to make sure that it's dispensing insulin. You can see here there's a little place where you count the units. We're going to load this up with 10 units. 10 units is a common starting dose. Each unit is a click. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And there it is, 10 units. We're now going to fire it. I'm going to squirt it into the garbage and you should be able to see the little jet of insulin. So we squirt it and we count to five after we've stopped and you can see the last drop is falling off. Now I don't have diabetes so I'm not going to give myself a shot but I'm going to pretend to give myself a shot. I'm going to put it up to 10 units and then I'm going to dial it back to zero just because I don't want to give myself any insulin. You of course are going to give yourself the required dose. Most people start on 10 units a day. So imagine I put the 10 units on. I'm taking it off. I then lift up my shirt and I stick it into my skin and then I inject and I count to five. One, two, three, four, five. Then I take it out and you finish the ejection. Now the manufacturers always tell you to replace the needle tip every time. I don't believe in that. That's wasted. You can use it four or five times. So if this were my insulin pen I would make sure I didn't touch the end of it.

The NPH insulin bottle. It should look cloudy. If there are any clumps of residue, throw it out. You want 100 syringe, alcohol swabs and a glass jar for the used syringe. Step 2. Preparing your insulin. Wipe the top of the bottles with an alcohol swab. Roll the NPH insulin between your hands. If your prescribed amount of NPH insulin is 5ml and you have a new bottle, inject 5ml of air into the vial. If your prescribed amount of regular NPH insulin is 5ml, also inject 5ml of air into the regular vial. Then, keeping the needle inside the regular bottle, turn it upside down. Pull the plunger back slowly for 5ml of NPH insulin. Make sure the top of the black rubber stopper is even with your required dose. Check for air bubbles. If there are air bubbles, lightly flick the syringe, pushing the bubble to the top of the syringe and then pushing it into the top of the bottle. Repeat these steps with the NPH insulin. Turn it upside down. Slowly pull the plunger back for 5ml. Good job. Step 3. Injection sites. Rotate amongst these sites. Back of the arm, buttocks, abdomen, thigh and back of hip. Clean your site with an alcohol swab and let it air dry. Step 4. Inject. Pinch a section of skin and inject at an angle of 90 degrees. Inject the insulin slowly and remove quickly. Do not recap the needle. Step 5. Flip the safety lock on the syringe and dispose of the needle in the sharps container. Use gentle pressure just to make sure there is no bleeding.

Preparing your insulin. Wipe the top of the bottles with an alcohol swab. Roll the NPH insulin between your hands. If your prescribed amount of NPH insulin is 5ml and you have a new bottle, inject 5ml of air into the vial. If your prescribed amount of regular NPH insulin is 5ml, also inject 5ml of air into the regular vial. Then, keeping the needle inside the regular bottle, turn it upside down. Pull the plunger back slowly for 5ml of NPH insulin. Make sure the top of the black rubber stopper is even with your required dose. Check for air bubbles. If there are air bubbles, lightly flick the syringe, pushing the bubble to the top of the syringe and then pushing it into the top of the bottle. Repeat these steps with the NPH insulin. Turn it upside down. Slowly pull the plunger back for 5ml. Good job. Step 3. Injection sites. Rotate amongst these sites. Back of the arm, buttocks, abdomen, thigh and back of hip. Clean your site with an alcohol swab and let it air dry. Step 4. Inject. Pinch a section of skin and inject at an angle of 90 degrees. Inject the insulin slowly and remove quickly. Do not recap the needle. Step 5. Flip the safety lock on the syringe and dispose of the needle in the sharps container. Use gentle pressure just to make sure there is no bleeding. Apply band aid if needed. And we are done."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: This video will teach you how to inject your insulin using a syringe. Please watch the entire video before injecting your insulin. Your healthcare provider may recommend that you inject insulin using a syringe to help you control your blood sugar level. Injecting insulin with a syringe involves choosing an injection site, preparing the syringe and insulin, and then injecting the insulin into your body. Your healthcare provider will tell you what type of insulin you need, as well as when and how much you need to inject. You will need alcohol wipes, your bottle of insulin, a new syringe for each injection, and a sharps disposal container to throw away the used syringes. A disposable syringe has the following parts, a barrel, a plunger, a needle cap, and a needle. Selecting the Injection Site. Before injecting your insulin, select the injection site on your body. The areas for insulin injection include the abdomen or belly, upper arms, the thighs, and the buttocks. When selecting the injection site, be sure you use a different spot each time you give yourself an injection. Leave at least one inch away from the last injection spot. Inject your insulin at least two inches from your belly button, and choose a spot one inch or farther away from any scar or mole. Preparing the Syringe and Insulin. Step one, wash your hands with soap and water, and then dry them. Step two, if your insulin needs to be mixed, gently roll the bottle between your hands. Do not shake the bottle because it may cause bubbles to form in your insulin. Before injecting yourself, check the insulin in the bottle to make sure it is the type of insulin your doctor prescribed for you, not past the expiration date, and the insulin is free of clumps. Step three, remove the cap from your insulin bottle. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber stopper on the top of the bottle. Step four, remove the syringe from its package. Be sure to use a new syringe each time you inject insulin. Step five, remove the needle cap from the syringe. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface, and do not use the syringe if the needle is bent. Some syringes have a cap over the plunger that you may need to remove as well. Step six, pull back the plunger to draw in an amount of air that is equal to your insulin dose. Step seven, hold your insulin bottle securely on a flat surface. Push the needle through the rubber on the top of the bottle. Push the plunger to inject the air into the insulin bottle. Leave the needle in the bottle. This helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw insulin into the syringe. Step eight, with the needle still in the bottle, turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Step nine, pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with just a little more than the insulin dose you need. If you see air bubbles, tap the barrel of the syringe with your finger to make them rise to the top. Slowly push in the plunger just enough to push out the air and extra insulin. Step ten, carefully check to make sure the amount of insulin in the syringe matches your insulin dose. Pull the needle out of the bottle and carefully lay the syringe on a flat, clean surface. Make sure the needle does not touch anything. Cleaning the Insulin Step one, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Use a circular motion to clean a spot about two inches wide. Step two, pinch a two-inch fold of skin in the cleaned injection spot. Step three, hold the syringe like a pencil and quickly insert the needle straight into your skin at a 90 degree angle. Make sure the whole needle enters your skin. Step four, push the plunger all the way down to inject the insulin into the fat tissue beneath your skin. Slowly count to five before removing the needle to make sure you have injected all of the insulin. Step five, pull the needle straight out to remove it. Step six, throw away the syringe into your sharps disposal container. Never throw your syringes or needles directly into the trash. Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about injecting your insulin or if your blood sugar level stays above or below your target range."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Inject your insulin at least two inches from your belly button, and choose a spot one inch or farther away from any scar or mole. Preparing the Syringe and Insulin. Step one, wash your hands with soap and water, and then dry them. Step two, if your insulin needs to be mixed, gently roll the bottle between your hands. Do not shake the bottle because it may cause bubbles to form in your insulin. Before injecting yourself, check the insulin in the bottle to make sure it is the type of insulin your doctor prescribed for you, not past the expiration date, and the insulin is free of clumps. Step three, remove the cap from your insulin bottle. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber stopper on the top of the bottle. Step four, remove the syringe from its package. Be sure to use a new syringe each time you inject insulin. Step five, remove the needle cap from the syringe. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface, and do not use the syringe if the needle is bent. Some syringes have a cap over the plunger that you may need to remove as well. Step six, pull back the plunger to draw in an amount of air that is equal to your insulin dose. Step seven, hold your insulin bottle securely on a flat surface. Push the needle through the rubber on the top of the bottle. Push the plunger to inject the air into the insulin bottle. Leave the needle in the bottle. This helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw insulin into the syringe. Step eight, with the needle still in the bottle, turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Step nine, pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with just a little more than the insulin dose you need. If you see air bubbles, tap the barrel of the syringe with your finger to make them rise to the top. Slowly push in the plunger just enough to push out the air and extra insulin. Step ten, carefully check to make sure the amount of insulin in the syringe matches your insulin dose. Pull the needle out of the bottle and carefully lay the syringe on a flat, clean surface. Make sure the needle does not touch anything. Cleaning the Insulin Step one, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Use a circular motion to clean a spot about two inches wide. Step two, pinch a two-inch fold of skin in the cleaned injection spot. Step three, hold the syringe like a pencil and quickly insert the needle straight into your skin at a 90 degree angle. Make sure the whole needle enters your skin. Step four, push the plunger all the way down to inject the insulin into the fat tissue beneath your skin. Slowly count to five before removing the needle to make sure you have injected all of the insulin. Step five, pull the needle straight out to remove it. Step six, throw away the syringe into your sharps disposal container. Never throw your syringes or needles directly into the trash. Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about injecting your insulin or if your blood sugar level stays above or below your target range."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Your healthcare provider may recommend that you inject insulin using a syringe to help you control your blood sugar level. Injecting insulin with a syringe involves choosing an injection site, preparing the syringe and insulin, and then injecting the insulin into your body. Your healthcare provider will tell you what type of insulin you need, as well as when and how much you need to inject. You will need alcohol wipes, your bottle of insulin, a new syringe for each injection, and a sharps disposal container to throw away the used syringes. A disposable syringe has the following parts, a barrel, a plunger, a needle cap, and a needle. Selecting the Injection Site. Before injecting your insulin, select the injection site on your body. The areas for insulin injection include the abdomen or belly, upper arms, the thighs, and the buttocks. When selecting the injection site, be sure you use a different spot each time you give yourself an injection. Leave at least one inch away from the last injection spot. Inject your insulin at least two inches from your belly button, and choose a spot one inch or farther away from any scar or mole. Preparing the Syringe and Insulin. Step one, wash your hands with soap and water, and then dry them. Step two, if your insulin needs to be mixed, gently roll the bottle between your hands. Do not shake the bottle because it may cause bubbles to form in your insulin. Before injecting yourself, check the insulin in the bottle to make sure it is the type of insulin your doctor prescribed for you, not past the expiration date, and the insulin is free of clumps. Step three, remove the cap from your insulin bottle. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber stopper on the top of the bottle. Step four, remove the syringe from its package. Be sure to use a new syringe each time you inject insulin. Step five, remove the needle cap from the syringe. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface, and do not use the syringe if the needle is bent. Some syringes have a cap over the plunger that you may need to remove as well. Step six, pull back the plunger to draw in an amount of air that is equal to your insulin dose. Step seven, hold your insulin bottle securely on a flat surface. Push the needle through the rubber on the top of the bottle. Push the plunger to inject the air into the insulin bottle. Leave the needle in the bottle. This helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw insulin into the syringe. Step eight, with the needle still in the bottle, turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Step nine, pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with just a little more than the insulin dose you need. If you see air bubbles, tap the barrel of the syringe with your finger to make them rise to the top. Slowly push in the plunger just enough to push out the air and extra insulin. Step ten, carefully check to make sure the amount of insulin in the syringe matches your insulin dose. Pull the needle out of the bottle and carefully lay the syringe on a flat, clean surface. Make sure the needle does not touch anything. Cleaning the Insulin Step one, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Use a circular motion to clean a spot about two inches wide. Step two, pinch a two-inch fold of skin in the cleaned injection spot. Step three, hold the syringe like a pencil and quickly insert the needle straight into your skin at a 90 degree angle. Make sure the whole needle enters your skin. Step four, push the plunger all the way down to inject the insulin into the fat tissue beneath your skin. Slowly count to five before removing the needle to make sure you have injected all of the insulin. Step five, pull the needle straight out to remove it. Step six, throw away the syringe into your sharps disposal container. Never throw your syringes or needles directly into the trash.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, I'm Dr. Emily Walker, a VA pharmacist, and I would like to discuss with you the proper way to give yourself insulin using an insulin pen. There are many different types of insulin pens available from the VA. In this video, I will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the Flex Pen. Other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include Flex Touch, Solastar, or Quick Pen. What is important for you to know is that the correct technique that I will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. Remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your VA provider. Let's get started. When you are preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. These supplies include your insulin Flex Pen or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. If you do not have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write USED NEEDLES on the side with a permanent marker. Before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. When your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. Next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. Do not use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin. By inspecting the insulin pen, you will also be double checking that you have the correct type of insulin. As I mentioned already, for our example today, I am using the Novolog Flex Pen, which has been pre-filled with insulin aspart. After inspecting the insulin pen, put it down and open an alcohol swab. Wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. Allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. Do not blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. Next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. Grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. Make sure you do not over tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. Next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. You will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. Remove the inner plastic needle cap. Both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. It is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. Never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. Next we will complete an air shot with the insulin pen, which should be done before each injection. An air shot is sometimes called priming. Doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. Turn the dial up to two units. Hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. Next, press the push button all the way in. The dial should return to zero. You should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. If the drop does not appear, repeat the process. This can be repeated up to six times. If it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. If that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. Next, select your insulin dose. Check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. The pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. The dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. For example, if you are prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. Be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. You will hear a click for each unit you dial. It is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose. Please note towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. Next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. If you just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. Remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. Insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks on the high hip upper outer area, thigh or upper arm, that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. The needle you are using is thin and may bend. You may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. It is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. If you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs or buttocks. Avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened or has lumps. Avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard. In addition, stay 1 to 2 inches away from your belly button, scars or skin with open wounds. If you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. For instance, give your basal or long-acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid-acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. Insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. Again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a 1 to 2 inch portion of skin in fact. Once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. Keep it pressed for a full 6 seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. Now you can remove the insulin pen. A small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. This is normal and can be expected. If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, I'm Dr. Emily Walker, a VA pharmacist, and I would like to discuss with you the proper way to give yourself insulin using an insulin pen. There are many different types of insulin pens available from the VA. In this video, I will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the Flex Pen. Other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include Flex Touch, Solastar, or Quick Pen. What is important for you to know is that the correct technique that I will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. Remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your VA provider. Let's get started. When you are preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. These supplies include your insulin Flex Pen or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. If you do not have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write USED NEEDLES on the side with a permanent marker. Before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. When your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. Next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. Do not use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin. By inspecting the insulin pen, you will also be double checking that you have the correct type of insulin. As I mentioned already, for our example today, I am using the Novolog Flex Pen, which has been pre-filled with insulin aspart. After inspecting the insulin pen, put it down and open an alcohol swab. Wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. Allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. Do not blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. Next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. Grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. Make sure you do not over tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. Next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. You will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. Remove the inner plastic needle cap. Both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. It is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. Never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. Next we will complete an air shot with the insulin pen, which should be done before each injection. An air shot is sometimes called priming. Doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. Turn the dial up to two units. Hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. Next, press the push button all the way in. The dial should return to zero. You should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. If the drop does not appear, repeat the process. This can be repeated up to six times. If it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. If that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. Next, select your insulin dose. Check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. The pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. The dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. For example, if you are prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. Be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. You will hear a click for each unit you dial. It is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose. Please note towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. Next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. If you just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. Remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. Insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks on the high hip upper outer area, thigh or upper arm, that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. The needle you are using is thin and may bend. You may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. It is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. If you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs or buttocks. Avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened or has lumps. Avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard. In addition, stay 1 to 2 inches away from your belly button, scars or skin with open wounds. If you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. For instance, give your basal or long-acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid-acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. Insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. Again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a 1 to 2 inch portion of skin in fact. Once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. Keep it pressed for a full 6 seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. Now you can remove the insulin pen. A small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. This is normal and can be expected. If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. Allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. Do not blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. Next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. Grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. Make sure you do not over tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. Next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. You will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. Remove the inner plastic needle cap. Both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. It is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. Never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. Next we will complete an air shot with the insulin pen, which should be done before each injection. An air shot is sometimes called priming. Doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. Turn the dial up to two units. Hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. Next, press the push button all the way in. The dial should return to zero. You should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. If the drop does not appear, repeat the process. This can be repeated up to six times. If it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. If that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. Next, select your insulin dose. Check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. The pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. The dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. For example, if you are prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. Be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. You will hear a click for each unit you dial. It is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose. Please note towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. Next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. If you just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. Remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. Insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks on the high hip upper outer area, thigh or upper arm, that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. The needle you are using is thin and may bend. You may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. It is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. If you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs or buttocks. Avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened or has lumps. Avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard. In addition, stay 1 to 2 inches away from your belly button, scars or skin with open wounds. If you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. For instance, give your basal or long-acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid-acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. Insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. Again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a 1 to 2 inch portion of skin in fact. Once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. Keep it pressed for a full 6 seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. Now you can remove the insulin pen. A small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. This is normal and can be expected. If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

There are many different types of insulin pens available from the VA. In this video, I will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the Flex Pen. Other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include Flex Touch, Solastar, or Quick Pen. What is important for you to know is that the correct technique that I will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. Remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your VA provider. Let's get started. When you are preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. These supplies include your insulin Flex Pen or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. If you do not have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write USED NEEDLES on the side with a permanent marker. Before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. When your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. Next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. Do not use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin.

Please note towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. Next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. If you just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. Remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. Insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks on the high hip upper outer area, thigh or upper arm, that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. The needle you are using is thin and may bend. You may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. It is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. If you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs or buttocks. Avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened or has lumps. Avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard. In addition, stay 1 to 2 inches away from your belly button, scars or skin with open wounds. If you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. For instance, give your basal or long-acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid-acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. Insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. Again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a 1 to 2 inch portion of skin in fact. Once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. Keep it pressed for a full 6 seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. Now you can remove the insulin pen. A small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. This is normal and can be expected. If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, I'm Dr. Emily Walker, a VA pharmacist, and I would like to discuss with you the proper way to give yourself insulin using an insulin pen. There are many different types of insulin pens available from the VA. In this video, I will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the Flex Pen. Other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include Flex Touch, Solastar, or Quick Pen. What is important for you to know is that the correct technique that I will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. Remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your VA provider. Let's get started. When you are preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. These supplies include your insulin Flex Pen or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. If you do not have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write USED NEEDLES on the side with a permanent marker. Before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. When your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. Next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. Do not use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin. By inspecting the insulin pen, you will also be double checking that you have the correct type of insulin. As I mentioned already, for our example today, I am using the Novolog Flex Pen, which has been pre-filled with insulin aspart. After inspecting the insulin pen, put it down and open an alcohol swab. Wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. Allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. Do not blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. Next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. Grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. Make sure you do not over tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. Next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. You will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. Remove the inner plastic needle cap. Both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. It is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. Never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. Next we will complete an air shot with the insulin pen, which should be done before each injection. An air shot is sometimes called priming. Doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. Turn the dial up to two units. Hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. Next, press the push button all the way in. The dial should return to zero. You should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. If the drop does not appear, repeat the process. This can be repeated up to six times. If it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. If that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. Next, select your insulin dose. Check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. The pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. The dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. For example, if you are prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. Be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. You will hear a click for each unit you dial. It is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose.

If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Dr. David has prescribed you a once daily insulin injection to help your glucose control improve. There are many different types of insulin and these are available in valves, cartridges and insulin pans. The insulin that is prescribed for you is a background insulin that comes in insulin pan device. The insulin pans are pre-filled with insulin and you can use it multiple times until the pan is empty. There are many different types of insulin pan devices each containing different types of insulin. These are coded with different colors and it is important for you to know the name of the insulin you are on, recognize the pan device and how much insulin you are supposed to give yourself. Now I'm going to show you how to use this insulin pan, demonstrate the injection technique followed by how best to care for and store the pan. Thank you for your explanation. I'm ready to start. First wash your hands before handling the insulin pan. Each time you are giving an insulin dose, you will need to prepare two alcohol swabs. Insulin pan needle. Insulin pan needles come in different lengths. In general, 4 to 6 mm needles should be sufficiently long. A hard container for the disposal of used needle. Step 1. Remove the pan cap. Clean the tip of the pan with an alcohol swab. Step 2. Remove the protective tab from the needle then attach the needle to the pan and screw tightly onto the pan. Remove the outer needle cap and put it aside. Remove and discard the inner cap. Pan devices should be primed according to the manufacturer instructions before each injection to remove any air bubbles and ensure that the pan and the needles are working properly. Some pans require 2 units and others require 3 units. Step 3. Prime the insulin pan to remove air bubbles and ensure that the needle is working properly. To do so, turn the dose selector to 2 units for this pan. Hold the pan with the needle pointing upwards and tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles will rise upwards towards the needle. Press the dosing button all the way till the dose selector turns to zero. Check and make sure you see a drop of insulin appearing at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the priming. Step 4. Check that the dose selector is set at zero after the safety check and turn to the required dose as ordered. Dr. David has prescribed 16 units. Turn the dose selector slowly until you see the number 16 lining out with the pointer. Let's try to do the injection now. Step 5. Clean the injection side with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry. Grip the pan firmly and insert the needle perpendicularly into the skin. Inject the insulin slowly. Lean people should consider using the Shouters needle 4mm and lifting a skin fold for injection. Press the dosing button all the way until the marking zero lines out with the pointer. Continue to press the dosing button and start counting slowly to 10. This is to ensure you have received the full dose of insulin. Redraw the needle before releasing the skin fold if applicable. Importantly, you should not inject true clothing. Step 6. Cover the needle with the big outer needle cap tightly and use it to unscrew the needle from the pan. Step 7. You will need a sharp container to discard the used needle. Now put the pan cap back. You can purchase sharp container from selected pharmacist. When the container is full, seal it before disposing of it. You must not discard used needle into regular rubbish beans. Insulin pan needles are only meant to be used just once to avoid the risk of infections. Besides, reusing needles will make them blunt and subsequent injection may hurt and cause bruising. You may inject over the abdomen within the following areas. Up to 1cm below the lowest rib, 1cm away from amyloid laterally towards the flanks and 1cm above the synthesis pubis. Injection sites should be rotated to avoid repeat tissue trauma. A good way for rotation will be to divide the injection sites into quadrants using one per week and moving quadrants to quadrants in a consistent direction. Injections should be rotated in such a way that there are space at least 1cm from each other. Rotating your injection sites will help prevent lumps and hardened tissue from forming. The new unopened insulin pans are to be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Insulin pan must not be frozen. Do remember to label each pan with a date when you have opened it. Aspired insulin must not be used. Thank you, Neswifen, for the detailed explanation and guidance. You're welcome."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Press the dosing button all the way until the marking zero lines out with the pointer. Continue to press the dosing button and start counting slowly to 10. This is to ensure you have received the full dose of insulin. Redraw the needle before releasing the skin fold if applicable. Importantly, you should not inject true clothing. Step 6. Cover the needle with the big outer needle cap tightly and use it to unscrew the needle from the pan. Step 7. You will need a sharp container to discard the used needle. Now put the pan cap back. You can purchase sharp container from selected pharmacist. When the container is full, seal it before disposing of it. You must not discard used needle into regular rubbish beans. Insulin pan needles are only meant to be used just once to avoid the risk of infections. Besides, reusing needles will make them blunt and subsequent injection may hurt and cause bruising. You may inject over the abdomen within the following areas. Up to 1cm below the lowest rib, 1cm away from amyloid laterally towards the flanks and 1cm above the synthesis pubis. Injection sites should be rotated to avoid repeat tissue trauma. A good way for rotation will be to divide the injection sites into quadrants using one per week and moving quadrants to quadrants in a consistent direction. Injections should be rotated in such a way that there are space at least 1cm from each other. Rotating your injection sites will help prevent lumps and hardened tissue from forming. The new unopened insulin pans are to be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Insulin pan must not be frozen. Do remember to label each pan with a date when you have opened it.

There are many different types of insulin pan devices each containing different types of insulin. These are coded with different colors and it is important for you to know the name of the insulin you are on, recognize the pan device and how much insulin you are supposed to give yourself. Now I'm going to show you how to use this insulin pan, demonstrate the injection technique followed by how best to care for and store the pan. Thank you for your explanation. I'm ready to start. First wash your hands before handling the insulin pan. Each time you are giving an insulin dose, you will need to prepare two alcohol swabs. Insulin pan needle. Insulin pan needles come in different lengths. In general, 4 to 6 mm needles should be sufficiently long. A hard container for the disposal of used needle. Step 1. Remove the pan cap. Clean the tip of the pan with an alcohol swab. Step 2. Remove the protective tab from the needle then attach the needle to the pan and screw tightly onto the pan. Remove the outer needle cap and put it aside. Remove and discard the inner cap. Pan devices should be primed according to the manufacturer instructions before each injection to remove any air bubbles and ensure that the pan and the needles are working properly. Some pans require 2 units and others require 3 units. Step 3. Prime the insulin pan to remove air bubbles and ensure that the needle is working properly. To do so, turn the dose selector to 2 units for this pan. Hold the pan with the needle pointing upwards and tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles will rise upwards towards the needle. Press the dosing button all the way till the dose selector turns to zero. Check and make sure you see a drop of insulin appearing at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the priming. Step 4. Check that the dose selector is set at zero after the safety check and turn to the required dose as ordered. Dr. David has prescribed 16 units. Turn the dose selector slowly until you see the number 16 lining out with the pointer. Let's try to do the injection now. Step 5. Clean the injection side with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry.

Step 4. Check that the dose selector is set at zero after the safety check and turn to the required dose as ordered. Dr. David has prescribed 16 units. Turn the dose selector slowly until you see the number 16 lining out with the pointer. Let's try to do the injection now. Step 5. Clean the injection side with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry. Grip the pan firmly and insert the needle perpendicularly into the skin. Inject the insulin slowly. Lean people should consider using the Shouters needle 4mm and lifting a skin fold for injection. Press the dosing button all the way until the marking zero lines out with the pointer. Continue to press the dosing button and start counting slowly to 10. This is to ensure you have received the full dose of insulin. Redraw the needle before releasing the skin fold if applicable. Importantly, you should not inject true clothing. Step 6. Cover the needle with the big outer needle cap tightly and use it to unscrew the needle from the pan. Step 7. You will need a sharp container to discard the used needle. Now put the pan cap back. You can purchase sharp container from selected pharmacist. When the container is full, seal it before disposing of it. You must not discard used needle into regular rubbish beans. Insulin pan needles are only meant to be used just once to avoid the risk of infections. Besides, reusing needles will make them blunt and subsequent injection may hurt and cause bruising. You may inject over the abdomen within the following areas. Up to 1cm below the lowest rib, 1cm away from amyloid laterally towards the flanks and 1cm above the synthesis pubis. Injection sites should be rotated to avoid repeat tissue trauma. A good way for rotation will be to divide the injection sites into quadrants using one per week and moving quadrants to quadrants in a consistent direction. Injections should be rotated in such a way that there are space at least 1cm from each other. Rotating your injection sites will help prevent lumps and hardened tissue from forming. The new unopened insulin pans are to be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Insulin pan must not be frozen. Do remember to label each pan with a date when you have opened it. Aspired insulin must not be used. Thank you, Neswifen, for the detailed explanation and guidance. You're welcome."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Good afternoon Ms Grace. I am a diabetes nurse educator. My name is Sui Fen. Dr. David has prescribed you a once daily insulin injection to help your glucose control improve. There are many different types of insulin and these are available in valves, cartridges and insulin pans. The insulin that is prescribed for you is a background insulin that comes in insulin pan device. The insulin pans are pre-filled with insulin and you can use it multiple times until the pan is empty. There are many different types of insulin pan devices each containing different types of insulin. These are coded with different colors and it is important for you to know the name of the insulin you are on, recognize the pan device and how much insulin you are supposed to give yourself. Now I'm going to show you how to use this insulin pan, demonstrate the injection technique followed by how best to care for and store the pan. Thank you for your explanation. I'm ready to start. First wash your hands before handling the insulin pan. Each time you are giving an insulin dose, you will need to prepare two alcohol swabs. Insulin pan needle. Insulin pan needles come in different lengths. In general, 4 to 6 mm needles should be sufficiently long. A hard container for the disposal of used needle. Step 1. Remove the pan cap. Clean the tip of the pan with an alcohol swab. Step 2. Remove the protective tab from the needle then attach the needle to the pan and screw tightly onto the pan. Remove the outer needle cap and put it aside. Remove and discard the inner cap. Pan devices should be primed according to the manufacturer instructions before each injection to remove any air bubbles and ensure that the pan and the needles are working properly. Some pans require 2 units and others require 3 units. Step 3. Prime the insulin pan to remove air bubbles and ensure that the needle is working properly. To do so, turn the dose selector to 2 units for this pan. Hold the pan with the needle pointing upwards and tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles will rise upwards towards the needle. Press the dosing button all the way till the dose selector turns to zero. Check and make sure you see a drop of insulin appearing at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the priming.

To prepare insulin for administration, first check the healthcare provider's orders. Determine the patient's blood glucose level. And when his next meal will be. The usual interval between injecting rapid acting insulin and eating a meal should be no more than 5 to 15 minutes. Different kinds of insulin have different times of onset, peak effects, and durations of action. Rapid acting types such as insulin lispro, aspart, and glulacine begin to act in 15 to 30 minutes and produce peak effects in 1 to 3 hours. These effects last 3 to 6 and a half hours. Short acting types including regular insulin begin to act in 30 minutes to 1 hour and produce their most significant effects in 1 to 5 hours. These effects last 6 to 10 hours. Intermediate acting types of insulin such as isophane insulin suspension start to act in 1 to 2 hours and exert their maximum effect in 6 to 14 hours. They last 16 to 24 hours. Insulin detemir or levomir begins to act in 0.8 to 2 hours and is non-peaking. Its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Because of these and other differences, the various types of insulin are not interchangeable and cannot be substituted for one another without the prescriber's approval. Once you've obtained the prescribed medication, check the label against the Medication Administration Record or MAR. Look at the date on the vial to make sure the insulin has not expired. If the medication has been refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before administering it. Select the insulin for changes that may indicate a loss of potency such as clumping, frosting, precipitation or altered color or clarity. If you're using a correction scale to administer the insulin, obtain a current bedside blood glucose and note the amount to draw up based on the patient's blood glucose. Now select an injection site. In an upper arm, the anterior or lateral aspect of a thigh, the buttocks or the abdomen, but avoid the 2 inch radius around the umbilicus. When choosing a site, consider the expected absorption rate. Insulin is absorbed fastest from the abdomen followed by the arms, thighs and buttocks. Remember to rotate sites. The patient can choose one area, such as the abdomen, and systematically rotate sites within that region. When all those sites are used, you can move to another region, such as the thigh, or he can start the rotation pattern over again in the same region. Draw up the insulin as shown in the video skill preparing injections from a vial, or mix a combination of insulins as shown in the video skill, drawing up more than one type of insulin. Compare the vial and the filled syringe with the MAR. Have another nurse verify that you've drawn up the correct dosage. If you draw up insulin away from the patient's bedside, place a label on the syringe indicating the type and amount of insulin it contains. When teaching patients to use an insulin administration pen, demonstrate how to remove the cap, insert and secure the disposable needle, and then dial the prescribed number of units.

Prior to that time, type 1 diabetes was really essentially a death sentence for those who were diagnosed with it. There are some very famous pictures of young children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and really became emaciated and looked like they were close to death. Then afterwards, after they had received insulin, looked like healthy young children that they should have been. So, the discovery of insulin changed type 1 diabetes from something that really couldn't be managed to something that became the experience, really not what we have today because it has evolved so much over time, but it allowed people to at least live day to day and eat and participate in activities. It really changed it from something that you are counting the days to a situation where you could live with it. The care and management of type 1 diabetes has evolved tremendously since the time that I was diagnosed. It was 1978 and I was four years old when I was diagnosed. Fall and spring tend to be those times where it really peaks and I had that same experience. It was just after Halloween and right before Thanksgiving. At that time, we had just a very limited amount or number of different types of insulin. When I was diagnosed, we were using pork insulin and we were testing sugar in the urine rather than in the bloodstream or now with continuous glucose monitoring, the subcutaneous space. So it was really very limited in terms of how we were able to manage it. I initially took two shots of two different types of insulin per day and I really felt like looking back, the approach was we are going to give a lot of insulin at one time and then you have to kind of keep up with it throughout the day by eating. Whereas today, we give insulin to try to match what we are going to eat. So it is a much more physiologic approach. Rather than feeding the insulin, we are using the insulin to cover what we choose to eat. In terms of the monitoring of diabetes, I think that has been a tremendous not only improvement but just an evolution of the way we did it. Initially when I was diagnosed, we had this little chemistry kit. You would collect the urine sample and then mix that with a tablet that created a little bubbling experiment and then you would hold it up to a chart. We did that several times a day but it really did not tell us very much information because the sugar that is in the urine really can be there over a number of hours where if you are testing sugar in the blood or in the subcutaneous space in the interstitial fluid, you are getting an immediate assessment of what the value is at that moment. So you can make much more informed decisions. The delivery of insulin has changed tremendously. I was on a couple of shots a day of insulin that really did not match up well with the foods that we were eating. One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do. And that has been something that has changed even over the last couple of years. So we are seeing, we saw a slow evolution over the last 30 years and then a really rapid evolution over the last 10 years in terms of delivery and monitoring. The relationship between someone with diabetes and their healthcare provider is really critical. It is so important to have a trusting and cooperative relationship to have success. The management of diabetes, unlike many, many health situations that we may encounter in the medical field, is one that is really managed primarily by the individual with diabetes on their own. I see someone with diabetes every three months or every six months in the office, but diabetes doesn't take a break during the times where they are not face-to-face with me. They are managing it minute-to-minute, day-to-day, making decisions that directly impact their diabetes control. And so building that trust and strengthening the person with diabetes knowledge and understanding of how diabetes is best managed really is critical. I feel like diabetes self-management is as critical as any aspect of diabetes management. And so if someone doesn't feel comfortable managing their own diabetes and doesn't trust that we have built up that knowledge and understanding, then they are really not going to have the same success as someone who feels confident and comfortable making decisions and adjusting the way they manage day-to-day. I really try to build trust and the foundation of a cooperative relationship with every patient that I see. I think it certainly helps that I have type 1 diabetes, and I don't keep that a secret. I tell people about it because I think it helps to build that trust. They can look across the table and see someone who has experienced many of the same situations that they've experienced, has an understanding of the trials and tribulations, the struggles that they may have gone through in their lifetime. I think the empathy that I can offer is really a strength that I have in terms of my interaction with individuals with type 1 diabetes. And I think that makes someone with diabetes more confident and more able to manage their diabetes both independently and in cooperation with myself. I really feel like that's a critical aspect of diabetes management. You know, I think in terms of the evolution of diabetes management, I think the automated insulin delivery platforms, using a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump together has really been one of the most important steps forward in diabetes management, taking away the minute-to-minute burden from those of us with diabetes while also improving the outcomes that we're getting has been such an important step forward."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Prior to that time, type 1 diabetes was really essentially a death sentence for those who were diagnosed with it. There are some very famous pictures of young children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and really became emaciated and looked like they were close to death. Then afterwards, after they had received insulin, looked like healthy young children that they should have been. So, the discovery of insulin changed type 1 diabetes from something that really couldn't be managed to something that became the experience, really not what we have today because it has evolved so much over time, but it allowed people to at least live day to day and eat and participate in activities. It really changed it from something that you are counting the days to a situation where you could live with it. The care and management of type 1 diabetes has evolved tremendously since the time that I was diagnosed. It was 1978 and I was four years old when I was diagnosed. Fall and spring tend to be those times where it really peaks and I had that same experience. It was just after Halloween and right before Thanksgiving. At that time, we had just a very limited amount or number of different types of insulin. When I was diagnosed, we were using pork insulin and we were testing sugar in the urine rather than in the bloodstream or now with continuous glucose monitoring, the subcutaneous space. So it was really very limited in terms of how we were able to manage it. I initially took two shots of two different types of insulin per day and I really felt like looking back, the approach was we are going to give a lot of insulin at one time and then you have to kind of keep up with it throughout the day by eating. Whereas today, we give insulin to try to match what we are going to eat. So it is a much more physiologic approach. Rather than feeding the insulin, we are using the insulin to cover what we choose to eat. In terms of the monitoring of diabetes, I think that has been a tremendous not only improvement but just an evolution of the way we did it. Initially when I was diagnosed, we had this little chemistry kit. You would collect the urine sample and then mix that with a tablet that created a little bubbling experiment and then you would hold it up to a chart. We did that several times a day but it really did not tell us very much information because the sugar that is in the urine really can be there over a number of hours where if you are testing sugar in the blood or in the subcutaneous space in the interstitial fluid, you are getting an immediate assessment of what the value is at that moment. So you can make much more informed decisions. The delivery of insulin has changed tremendously. I was on a couple of shots a day of insulin that really did not match up well with the foods that we were eating. One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do. And that has been something that has changed even over the last couple of years. So we are seeing, we saw a slow evolution over the last 30 years and then a really rapid evolution over the last 10 years in terms of delivery and monitoring. The relationship between someone with diabetes and their healthcare provider is really critical. It is so important to have a trusting and cooperative relationship to have success. The management of diabetes, unlike many, many health situations that we may encounter in the medical field, is one that is really managed primarily by the individual with diabetes on their own. I see someone with diabetes every three months or every six months in the office, but diabetes doesn't take a break during the times where they are not face-to-face with me. They are managing it minute-to-minute, day-to-day, making decisions that directly impact their diabetes control. And so building that trust and strengthening the person with diabetes knowledge and understanding of how diabetes is best managed really is critical. I feel like diabetes self-management is as critical as any aspect of diabetes management. And so if someone doesn't feel comfortable managing their own diabetes and doesn't trust that we have built up that knowledge and understanding, then they are really not going to have the same success as someone who feels confident and comfortable making decisions and adjusting the way they manage day-to-day. I really try to build trust and the foundation of a cooperative relationship with every patient that I see. I think it certainly helps that I have type 1 diabetes, and I don't keep that a secret. I tell people about it because I think it helps to build that trust. They can look across the table and see someone who has experienced many of the same situations that they've experienced, has an understanding of the trials and tribulations, the struggles that they may have gone through in their lifetime. I think the empathy that I can offer is really a strength that I have in terms of my interaction with individuals with type 1 diabetes. And I think that makes someone with diabetes more confident and more able to manage their diabetes both independently and in cooperation with myself.

So you can make much more informed decisions. The delivery of insulin has changed tremendously. I was on a couple of shots a day of insulin that really did not match up well with the foods that we were eating. One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do. And that has been something that has changed even over the last couple of years. So we are seeing, we saw a slow evolution over the last 30 years and then a really rapid evolution over the last 10 years in terms of delivery and monitoring. The relationship between someone with diabetes and their healthcare provider is really critical. It is so important to have a trusting and cooperative relationship to have success. The management of diabetes, unlike many, many health situations that we may encounter in the medical field, is one that is really managed primarily by the individual with diabetes on their own. I see someone with diabetes every three months or every six months in the office, but diabetes doesn't take a break during the times where they are not face-to-face with me. They are managing it minute-to-minute, day-to-day, making decisions that directly impact their diabetes control. And so building that trust and strengthening the person with diabetes knowledge and understanding of how diabetes is best managed really is critical. I feel like diabetes self-management is as critical as any aspect of diabetes management. And so if someone doesn't feel comfortable managing their own diabetes and doesn't trust that we have built up that knowledge and understanding, then they are really not going to have the same success as someone who feels confident and comfortable making decisions and adjusting the way they manage day-to-day. I really try to build trust and the foundation of a cooperative relationship with every patient that I see. I think it certainly helps that I have type 1 diabetes, and I don't keep that a secret. I tell people about it because I think it helps to build that trust. They can look across the table and see someone who has experienced many of the same situations that they've experienced, has an understanding of the trials and tribulations, the struggles that they may have gone through in their lifetime. I think the empathy that I can offer is really a strength that I have in terms of my interaction with individuals with type 1 diabetes. And I think that makes someone with diabetes more confident and more able to manage their diabetes both independently and in cooperation with myself. I really feel like that's a critical aspect of diabetes management. You know, I think in terms of the evolution of diabetes management, I think the automated insulin delivery platforms, using a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump together has really been one of the most important steps forward in diabetes management, taking away the minute-to-minute burden from those of us with diabetes while also improving the outcomes that we're getting has been such an important step forward."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Prior to that time, type 1 diabetes was really essentially a death sentence for those who were diagnosed with it. There are some very famous pictures of young children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and really became emaciated and looked like they were close to death. Then afterwards, after they had received insulin, looked like healthy young children that they should have been. So, the discovery of insulin changed type 1 diabetes from something that really couldn't be managed to something that became the experience, really not what we have today because it has evolved so much over time, but it allowed people to at least live day to day and eat and participate in activities. It really changed it from something that you are counting the days to a situation where you could live with it. The care and management of type 1 diabetes has evolved tremendously since the time that I was diagnosed. It was 1978 and I was four years old when I was diagnosed. Fall and spring tend to be those times where it really peaks and I had that same experience. It was just after Halloween and right before Thanksgiving. At that time, we had just a very limited amount or number of different types of insulin. When I was diagnosed, we were using pork insulin and we were testing sugar in the urine rather than in the bloodstream or now with continuous glucose monitoring, the subcutaneous space. So it was really very limited in terms of how we were able to manage it. I initially took two shots of two different types of insulin per day and I really felt like looking back, the approach was we are going to give a lot of insulin at one time and then you have to kind of keep up with it throughout the day by eating. Whereas today, we give insulin to try to match what we are going to eat. So it is a much more physiologic approach. Rather than feeding the insulin, we are using the insulin to cover what we choose to eat. In terms of the monitoring of diabetes, I think that has been a tremendous not only improvement but just an evolution of the way we did it. Initially when I was diagnosed, we had this little chemistry kit.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: The discovery of insulin really changed the life of someone with diabetes when it was discovered 100 years ago. Prior to that time, type 1 diabetes was really essentially a death sentence for those who were diagnosed with it. There are some very famous pictures of young children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and really became emaciated and looked like they were close to death. Then afterwards, after they had received insulin, looked like healthy young children that they should have been. So, the discovery of insulin changed type 1 diabetes from something that really couldn't be managed to something that became the experience, really not what we have today because it has evolved so much over time, but it allowed people to at least live day to day and eat and participate in activities. It really changed it from something that you are counting the days to a situation where you could live with it. The care and management of type 1 diabetes has evolved tremendously since the time that I was diagnosed. It was 1978 and I was four years old when I was diagnosed. Fall and spring tend to be those times where it really peaks and I had that same experience. It was just after Halloween and right before Thanksgiving. At that time, we had just a very limited amount or number of different types of insulin. When I was diagnosed, we were using pork insulin and we were testing sugar in the urine rather than in the bloodstream or now with continuous glucose monitoring, the subcutaneous space. So it was really very limited in terms of how we were able to manage it. I initially took two shots of two different types of insulin per day and I really felt like looking back, the approach was we are going to give a lot of insulin at one time and then you have to kind of keep up with it throughout the day by eating. Whereas today, we give insulin to try to match what we are going to eat. So it is a much more physiologic approach. Rather than feeding the insulin, we are using the insulin to cover what we choose to eat. In terms of the monitoring of diabetes, I think that has been a tremendous not only improvement but just an evolution of the way we did it. Initially when I was diagnosed, we had this little chemistry kit. You would collect the urine sample and then mix that with a tablet that created a little bubbling experiment and then you would hold it up to a chart. We did that several times a day but it really did not tell us very much information because the sugar that is in the urine really can be there over a number of hours where if you are testing sugar in the blood or in the subcutaneous space in the interstitial fluid, you are getting an immediate assessment of what the value is at that moment. So you can make much more informed decisions. The delivery of insulin has changed tremendously. I was on a couple of shots a day of insulin that really did not match up well with the foods that we were eating. One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do. And that has been something that has changed even over the last couple of years. So we are seeing, we saw a slow evolution over the last 30 years and then a really rapid evolution over the last 10 years in terms of delivery and monitoring. The relationship between someone with diabetes and their healthcare provider is really critical. It is so important to have a trusting and cooperative relationship to have success. The management of diabetes, unlike many, many health situations that we may encounter in the medical field, is one that is really managed primarily by the individual with diabetes on their own. I see someone with diabetes every three months or every six months in the office, but diabetes doesn't take a break during the times where they are not face-to-face with me. They are managing it minute-to-minute, day-to-day, making decisions that directly impact their diabetes control. And so building that trust and strengthening the person with diabetes knowledge and understanding of how diabetes is best managed really is critical. I feel like diabetes self-management is as critical as any aspect of diabetes management. And so if someone doesn't feel comfortable managing their own diabetes and doesn't trust that we have built up that knowledge and understanding, then they are really not going to have the same success as someone who feels confident and comfortable making decisions and adjusting the way they manage day-to-day. I really try to build trust and the foundation of a cooperative relationship with every patient that I see. I think it certainly helps that I have type 1 diabetes, and I don't keep that a secret. I tell people about it because I think it helps to build that trust. They can look across the table and see someone who has experienced many of the same situations that they've experienced, has an understanding of the trials and tribulations, the struggles that they may have gone through in their lifetime. I think the empathy that I can offer is really a strength that I have in terms of my interaction with individuals with type 1 diabetes. And I think that makes someone with diabetes more confident and more able to manage their diabetes both independently and in cooperation with myself. I really feel like that's a critical aspect of diabetes management. You know, I think in terms of the evolution of diabetes management, I think the automated insulin delivery platforms, using a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump together has really been one of the most important steps forward in diabetes management, taking away the minute-to-minute burden from those of us with diabetes while also improving the outcomes that we're getting has been such an important step forward."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Firstly, it's important to make sure that the insulin is given to the right person as everyone's requirements are different. You should check their wristband to make sure. Secondly, there are many types of insulin so it's crucial to make sure you prescribe or administer the correct insulin for the patient. Insulin works differently, some quickly and some slowly. Insulin is a time critical drug so it's important to give it at the right time. Patients who are able should be encouraged to administer their own insulin and complete a self-administration of insulin assessment. The dose of insulin can vary depending on factors such as weight, diabetes type and activity levels and it can change over time. Right device, if insulin is being given using a syringe you need to ensure it is an insulin safety syringe. Insulin should only be withdrawn from an insulin vial, not a pre-filled pen or cartridge. Insulin is available in cartridges, pre-filled pens and vials. Some people use insulin pumps. Insulin should be injected at a 90 degree angle. You can use the upper outer thighs, abdomen, upper buttocks and back of the arms. The injection site should be varied to avoid lipohypertrophy or fatty lumps. The insulin pen needle should be changed every time insulin is administered. Finally, we encourage all staff to complete the insulin safety module on the DOT platform. It's important to use insulin safety and correctly to ensure the best possible care for our patients. To remind you, the six R's of insulin safety include the right person, right insulin, right time, right dose, right device and right way."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Firstly, it's important to make sure that the insulin is given to the right person as everyone's requirements are different. You should check their wristband to make sure. Secondly, there are many types of insulin so it's crucial to make sure you prescribe or administer the correct insulin for the patient. Insulin works differently, some quickly and some slowly. Insulin is a time critical drug so it's important to give it at the right time. Patients who are able should be encouraged to administer their own insulin and complete a self-administration of insulin assessment. The dose of insulin can vary depending on factors such as weight, diabetes type and activity levels and it can change over time. Right device, if insulin is being given using a syringe you need to ensure it is an insulin safety syringe. Insulin should only be withdrawn from an insulin vial, not a pre-filled pen or cartridge. Insulin is available in cartridges, pre-filled pens and vials. Some people use insulin pumps. Insulin should be injected at a 90 degree angle. You can use the upper outer thighs, abdomen, upper buttocks and back of the arms. The injection site should be varied to avoid lipohypertrophy or fatty lumps. The insulin pen needle should be changed every time insulin is administered. Finally, we encourage all staff to complete the insulin safety module on the DOT platform. It's important to use insulin safety and correctly to ensure the best possible care for our patients.

Well, you know, and the sun. Good morning class. Good morning. My name is Nurse Nancy. I'm going to be your nurse facilitator for today. We're going to go ahead and talk about the importance of insulin injections. What are we injecting? Insulin. I'm Priscilla Cutting and this is my friend Loretta Jones. Hi Loretta. Hi. Well, welcome both of you to my class. First let me go ahead and assess your understanding of insulin. Do you both know what it's used for? Excuse me nurse, can you please speak up just a little bit? Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use. There's correct dosing. It makes it more accurate, things like that. Can I see one of those please? Sure, you can. So small. It is small. It really does look like a chicken. And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it. So after you've chosen a correct site, like I was saying, your abdomen or the back of your arm, you want to go ahead and make sure that you have a clean site. You would use one of these alcohol wipes like this. All right. One for you. One for you. So using the site that you've chosen, you want to go ahead and clean it. My little alcohol swab. You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day. It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro. I don't know about this one right here. Hey. I'm okay. Okay."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day. It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro.

Well, you know, and the sun. Good morning class. Good morning. My name is Nurse Nancy. I'm going to be your nurse facilitator for today. We're going to go ahead and talk about the importance of insulin injections. What are we injecting? Insulin. I'm Priscilla Cutting and this is my friend Loretta Jones. Hi Loretta. Hi. Well, welcome both of you to my class. First let me go ahead and assess your understanding of insulin. Do you both know what it's used for? Excuse me nurse, can you please speak up just a little bit? Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use. There's correct dosing. It makes it more accurate, things like that. Can I see one of those please? Sure, you can. So small. It is small. It really does look like a chicken. And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it. So after you've chosen a correct site, like I was saying, your abdomen or the back of your arm, you want to go ahead and make sure that you have a clean site. You would use one of these alcohol wipes like this. All right. One for you. One for you. So using the site that you've chosen, you want to go ahead and clean it. My little alcohol swab. You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on.

Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use. There's correct dosing. It makes it more accurate, things like that. Can I see one of those please? Sure, you can. So small. It is small. It really does look like a chicken. And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it. So after you've chosen a correct site, like I was saying, your abdomen or the back of your arm, you want to go ahead and make sure that you have a clean site. You would use one of these alcohol wipes like this. All right. One for you. One for you. So using the site that you've chosen, you want to go ahead and clean it. My little alcohol swab. You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day. It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro. I don't know about this one right here. Hey. I'm okay. Okay."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro. I don't know about this one right here. Hey. I'm okay. Okay."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Well, you know, and the sun. Good morning class. Good morning. My name is Nurse Nancy. I'm going to be your nurse facilitator for today. We're going to go ahead and talk about the importance of insulin injections. What are we injecting? Insulin. I'm Priscilla Cutting and this is my friend Loretta Jones. Hi Loretta. Hi. Well, welcome both of you to my class. First let me go ahead and assess your understanding of insulin. Do you both know what it's used for? Excuse me nurse, can you please speak up just a little bit? Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use. There's correct dosing. It makes it more accurate, things like that. Can I see one of those please? Sure, you can. So small. It is small. It really does look like a chicken. And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it. So after you've chosen a correct site, like I was saying, your abdomen or the back of your arm, you want to go ahead and make sure that you have a clean site. You would use one of these alcohol wipes like this. All right. One for you. One for you. So using the site that you've chosen, you want to go ahead and clean it. My little alcohol swab. You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day.

Before we start, we need to assess our patients or their caregivers on the pain knowledge related to self-administered insulin pain. The teaching today will focus on the patient or the caregiver being first time introduced to self-administered insulin pain. Firstly, you have to provide basic information regarding the insulin pain itself. For example, the name of the insulin, what is the color code, the dosage and frequency, there's how many units and how many times per day and when they're going to inject this insulin. Followed by, introduce the equipment that's needed for the procedure. There's three, insulin pain, needle and alcohol swabs. Introduce all the parts of insulin pain and needle to the patient or caregiver if can. If the patient is using this type of insulin pain, they need to learn how to insert the pain pill into the cartridge holder. Firstly, you have to pull off the pain cap and unscrew the cartridge holder. If the rock is sticking out, push it all the way back. Insert the insulin into the cartridge holder, remember color code and first. And screw the cartridge holder back together and twist it until you can feel or hear a click sound. If the insulin is cloudy type, the patient have to always mix evenly before use. There's two ways to do about it. First, you can gently roll the pain between your palm for 10 times or you move the pain up and down for 10 times. After this, we need to assemble the needle on the insulin pad. First, clean the rubber shield with alcohol swabs. Remove the protective tab from the disposable needle and attach to the insulin pad. Remember, the needle is single use. Now, the pen is ready to be used. Before injecting to the patient, the patient need to prime the needle and make sure there is no air injected into the body. First, remove the both outer and inner needle caps. Dispose the inner cap but keep the outer cap. How to prime the needle? Turn the dosage button to 2 limits. Hold the insulin pen with the needle pointing upwards and press it until it returns to 0. A drop of insulin should be appeared at the tip of the needle. Now, you are ready to be injected into the body. If the insulin dose didn't appear, please repeat the steps. When the insulin pen is ready, turn the dose selected to the number that is needed as instructed by the doctor. Now, where to inject? For cells administered with insulin, the patient are advised to use abdomen and thigh. Abdomen is generally recommended. The area can be injected on the abdomen is 1 inch away from the umbilical cord. And remember to tell the patient to rotate the spot to avoid complications. After the area has been identified, the patient is advised to use a wet cloth to clean the area. Then, insert the needle at 90 degrees and press the button all the way until it is 0. And remain the needle in the skin and count 1 to 10 to ensure the full dose is been injected. Then, pull out the needle. After injection, lead the needle tips into the outer needle caps and unscrew the needle and dispose into a puncture-proof container. Now it's come to end of the session. If you have time, you are advised to read out further information about the insulin pen. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, good day to you. Today we're going to learn how to educate patients on self-administered insulin pain. Before we start, we need to assess our patients or their caregivers on the pain knowledge related to self-administered insulin pain. The teaching today will focus on the patient or the caregiver being first time introduced to self-administered insulin pain. Firstly, you have to provide basic information regarding the insulin pain itself. For example, the name of the insulin, what is the color code, the dosage and frequency, there's how many units and how many times per day and when they're going to inject this insulin. Followed by, introduce the equipment that's needed for the procedure. There's three, insulin pain, needle and alcohol swabs. Introduce all the parts of insulin pain and needle to the patient or caregiver if can. If the patient is using this type of insulin pain, they need to learn how to insert the pain pill into the cartridge holder. Firstly, you have to pull off the pain cap and unscrew the cartridge holder. If the rock is sticking out, push it all the way back. Insert the insulin into the cartridge holder, remember color code and first. And screw the cartridge holder back together and twist it until you can feel or hear a click sound. If the insulin is cloudy type, the patient have to always mix evenly before use. There's two ways to do about it. First, you can gently roll the pain between your palm for 10 times or you move the pain up and down for 10 times. After this, we need to assemble the needle on the insulin pad. First, clean the rubber shield with alcohol swabs. Remove the protective tab from the disposable needle and attach to the insulin pad. Remember, the needle is single use. Now, the pen is ready to be used. Before injecting to the patient, the patient need to prime the needle and make sure there is no air injected into the body. First, remove the both outer and inner needle caps. Dispose the inner cap but keep the outer cap. How to prime the needle? Turn the dosage button to 2 limits. Hold the insulin pen with the needle pointing upwards and press it until it returns to 0. A drop of insulin should be appeared at the tip of the needle. Now, you are ready to be injected into the body. If the insulin dose didn't appear, please repeat the steps. When the insulin pen is ready, turn the dose selected to the number that is needed as instructed by the doctor. Now, where to inject? For cells administered with insulin, the patient are advised to use abdomen and thigh. Abdomen is generally recommended. The area can be injected on the abdomen is 1 inch away from the umbilical cord. And remember to tell the patient to rotate the spot to avoid complications. After the area has been identified, the patient is advised to use a wet cloth to clean the area. Then, insert the needle at 90 degrees and press the button all the way until it is 0. And remain the needle in the skin and count 1 to 10 to ensure the full dose is been injected. Then, pull out the needle. After injection, lead the needle tips into the outer needle caps and unscrew the needle and dispose into a puncture-proof container. Now it's come to end of the session. If you have time, you are advised to read out further information about the insulin pen. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

I will be injecting semaglutide but this works with other things like peptides or any subcutaneous injection, insulin for example. But we're going to do semaglutide today and I'm going to show you how to do it with my clothes over me first and then we're actually going to go ahead and do it. So step one, you want to wash your hands and after you've done that, then you identify the best spot. For us, we're going to do the abdomen and what you do is you want to pinch the fat and doing this will bring all the fat close to the surface so that you ensure that you actually get it into the right spot. So as you pinch, you're going to clean with alcohol and then I like to fan it so that it dries the alcohol, otherwise you'll taste it as you inject. After that, you're going to inject at a 90-degree angle, so straight in and then after that you're going to deploy the medicine and then you pull it out and then you're done. Subcutaneous needles are very small, so this one is a 31-gauge and it's about the width of my fingernail, so it's very, very small. So if we're ready, we'll begin. So you pull your shirt off, obviously, and you're going to clean with alcohol, fan it, and then you go ahead and you add a 90-degree angle, it's going to go straight in and then you're going to push it in. You really will not even feel this because the needle is so thin. Then you let go and you are all set. Once again, my name is Oscar. I'm from Smooth Aesthetics.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hello, I'm Joshua Freitas. I'm going to be instructing a group of individuals about insulin administration. Now, this targeted audience is going to be very wide because anybody can be diagnosed as a diabetic and need to inject insulin due to their blood sugar being too high. So we're talking about insulin administration. This is for my nursing, teaching, and education class here. And like I said, I'm Joshua Freitas. Moving on here. What you want to look for when you're administering insulin or diabetic are signs of hypoglycemia. Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst. Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Now, this targeted audience is going to be very wide because anybody can be diagnosed as a diabetic and need to inject insulin due to their blood sugar being too high. So we're talking about insulin administration. This is for my nursing, teaching, and education class here. And like I said, I'm Joshua Freitas. Moving on here. What you want to look for when you're administering insulin or diabetic are signs of hypoglycemia. Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst.

Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hello, I'm Joshua Freitas. I'm going to be instructing a group of individuals about insulin administration. Now, this targeted audience is going to be very wide because anybody can be diagnosed as a diabetic and need to inject insulin due to their blood sugar being too high. So we're talking about insulin administration. This is for my nursing, teaching, and education class here. And like I said, I'm Joshua Freitas. Moving on here. What you want to look for when you're administering insulin or diabetic are signs of hypoglycemia. Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst. Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly.

Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hello, I'm Joshua Freitas. I'm going to be instructing a group of individuals about insulin administration. Now, this targeted audience is going to be very wide because anybody can be diagnosed as a diabetic and need to inject insulin due to their blood sugar being too high. So we're talking about insulin administration. This is for my nursing, teaching, and education class here. And like I said, I'm Joshua Freitas. Moving on here. What you want to look for when you're administering insulin or diabetic are signs of hypoglycemia. Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst. Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good.

Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

And then afterwards, you have to remember which side of the stomach you've given it, left side or right side. And each time you give it, you have to alternate. So let's say this time you've given it to the right side. All right, let's give it on a different area on the left side.

I'm Mila, I have latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, which is a slow progressing form of type one diabetes. And I make videos about diabetes lifestyle, cooking, diabetes topics, stigma, all kinds of stuff about diabetes. If you like that kind of content and you're looking for someone like you and you're looking for a community of people who understand you and understand where you're coming from, you can join us here by hitting the thumbs up button and subscribing to this channel. Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye.

Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye.

And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye.

Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two.

So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day.

So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye.

Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do.

There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye. Bye."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: In this video, we'll be demonstrating the correct technique for injecting insulin using an insulin pen. But first, let's review the parts of an insulin pen. There is an insulin reservoir which contains all the insulin. There is a rubber stopper, which is where you will attach the insulin pen needle. There is a dosing window, which shows you how many units you've selected. And next to the dosing window is a dosing dial and an injection button. Now, let's gather up all the supplies we'll need. You'll need an alcohol wipe, your insulin pen, and a new pen needle. Remember, pen needles are designed for one-time use only, so every time you inject insulin, you should be using a fresh pen needle. First, remove the cap of your insulin pen. Then, take your alcohol wipe and swab the rubber stopper at the tip of the pen. Next, we're going to connect the pen needle. To do this, peel off the paper tab. Then, place the needle straight onto the pen and twist the pen needle on until it's secure. It doesn't need to be overly tight, just secure. The next step is to remove the two safety caps on the needle. Set aside the larger, clear cap because when you're all done, you're going to use it again to safely remove the needle. The smaller, inner shield should also be removed but can be thrown away. The next step is to perform a test shot to make sure there are no blockages to the flow of insulin and to remove potential air from the tip of the needle. To do this, turn the dosing dial on the pen until it says 2 in the dosing window. Next, hold the pen with the needle pointing straight up. If you see any air bubbles in the insulin reservoir, gently tap the pen until the bubbles move to the top. Next, press the dosing button. You should see a few drops appear at the tip of the needle, or a small stream of insulin can also shoot out. Once you've performed the test shot, you are ready to inject your dose. Turn the dosing dial until your prescribed dose appears in the window. You'll notice that only even numbers appear, but each line represents one unit. So, for example, if your dose was 5 units, the line you'd select is between the 4 and the 6. Once you've selected the right amount to give, clean the area where you are going to inject. Since insulin is injected into the fatty tissue, the options for injecting include the stomach, the outer part of your thighs, the back of your upper arm, and the upper buttock. When injecting insulin, it's important to remember that injection sites should be rotated, meaning pick a different site every time. Not rotating properly can result in changes to the skin, which can impact insulin absorption. How far away does your next injection site have to be? Well, one finger in between injection sites is sufficient to properly rotate. Insert the pen needle at a 90 degree angle. Once the needle is under the skin, press the dosing button down and count for at least 5-10 seconds with the button pressed down. Counting will help ensure that the entire dose has enough time to fully deliver. When you're done, it's time to remove the needle. Place the large, clear cap back on the insulin pen. Untwist the needle in the other direction until the needle comes completely off the pen. Then, properly dispose of the needle in a plastic, puncture-proof container with a lid. Finally, place the cap of the pen back on and safely store it. If you have any questions regarding your injection technique or the use of an insulin pen, please contact your primary care provider or diabetes specialist.

So, for example, if your dose was 5 units, the line you'd select is between the 4 and the 6. Once you've selected the right amount to give, clean the area where you are going to inject. Since insulin is injected into the fatty tissue, the options for injecting include the stomach, the outer part of your thighs, the back of your upper arm, and the upper buttock. When injecting insulin, it's important to remember that injection sites should be rotated, meaning pick a different site every time. Not rotating properly can result in changes to the skin, which can impact insulin absorption. How far away does your next injection site have to be? Well, one finger in between injection sites is sufficient to properly rotate. Insert the pen needle at a 90 degree angle. Once the needle is under the skin, press the dosing button down and count for at least 5-10 seconds with the button pressed down. Counting will help ensure that the entire dose has enough time to fully deliver. When you're done, it's time to remove the needle. Place the large, clear cap back on the insulin pen. Untwist the needle in the other direction until the needle comes completely off the pen. Then, properly dispose of the needle in a plastic, puncture-proof container with a lid. Finally, place the cap of the pen back on and safely store it. If you have any questions regarding your injection technique or the use of an insulin pen, please contact your primary care provider or diabetes specialist.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: In this video, we'll be demonstrating the correct technique for injecting insulin using an insulin pen. But first, let's review the parts of an insulin pen. There is an insulin reservoir which contains all the insulin. There is a rubber stopper, which is where you will attach the insulin pen needle. There is a dosing window, which shows you how many units you've selected. And next to the dosing window is a dosing dial and an injection button. Now, let's gather up all the supplies we'll need. You'll need an alcohol wipe, your insulin pen, and a new pen needle. Remember, pen needles are designed for one-time use only, so every time you inject insulin, you should be using a fresh pen needle. First, remove the cap of your insulin pen. Then, take your alcohol wipe and swab the rubber stopper at the tip of the pen. Next, we're going to connect the pen needle. To do this, peel off the paper tab. Then, place the needle straight onto the pen and twist the pen needle on until it's secure. It doesn't need to be overly tight, just secure. The next step is to remove the two safety caps on the needle. Set aside the larger, clear cap because when you're all done, you're going to use it again to safely remove the needle. The smaller, inner shield should also be removed but can be thrown away. The next step is to perform a test shot to make sure there are no blockages to the flow of insulin and to remove potential air from the tip of the needle. To do this, turn the dosing dial on the pen until it says 2 in the dosing window. Next, hold the pen with the needle pointing straight up. If you see any air bubbles in the insulin reservoir, gently tap the pen until the bubbles move to the top. Next, press the dosing button.

Well, one finger in between injection sites is sufficient to properly rotate. Insert the pen needle at a 90 degree angle. Once the needle is under the skin, press the dosing button down and count for at least 5-10 seconds with the button pressed down. Counting will help ensure that the entire dose has enough time to fully deliver. When you're done, it's time to remove the needle. Place the large, clear cap back on the insulin pen. Untwist the needle in the other direction until the needle comes completely off the pen. Then, properly dispose of the needle in a plastic, puncture-proof container with a lid. Finally, place the cap of the pen back on and safely store it. If you have any questions regarding your injection technique or the use of an insulin pen, please contact your primary care provider or diabetes specialist.

You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button. Once the cap is removed, you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window. In addition to a prescription for your insulin pen, you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor. You will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen. Now, we will review the steps that you should complete for each insulin injection. We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need. In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button. Once the cap is removed, you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window. In addition to a prescription for your insulin pen, you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor. You will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen. Now, we will review the steps that you should complete for each insulin injection. We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need.

We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need. In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button. Once the cap is removed, you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window.

You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button. Once the cap is removed, you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window. In addition to a prescription for your insulin pen, you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor. You will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen. Now, we will review the steps that you should complete for each insulin injection. We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need. In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen.

Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

First you need to gather your supplies, which would be the insulin pen itself, an alcohol swab, and the pen needle. Then you want to wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol sanitation solution. Rub your hands together until it's dry. Start by removing the cap to the pen. At this point, if you have cloudy insulin, which would include NPH insulin or a mixture thereof, you want to mix it. You mix it with your palms, like rolling it together, or you can go gently back and forth. You don't want to rigorously shake it. If you have clear insulin that does not contain NPH, then you don't have to mix. You can skip that part altogether. Use your alcohol wipe to wipe the rubber membrane on the end of the pen. And then remove the protective tab on the pen needle. Push the needle into the end of the pen and turn it clockwise to tighten it. Next you want to do what we call a safety check to make sure there's no air in the system. You'll dial the dose indicator to two units, remove the outer needle cap, and save that for later. The inner needle cap you can remove and throw away. So you've dialed to two units. You're going to push on the injector button and watch the end of the needle to make sure that you see some insulin come out. It might be a stream or it might be just drops of insulin. As long as you see liquid there, you know that there's no air in the system. Next you're going to dial the dose that's been prescribed for you. For example, if five units is my dose, I'll dial to the mark right between the four and the six. And I'm ready to give it. The preferred site for insulin administration is the abdomen. The abdomen is from your rib cage to your hips and as far laterally as you can comfortably reach. You want to rotate sites so that you're not returning to the same couple places again and again. You should be about two finger widths away from your belly button. So first expose the injection site. Hold your pen like a writing pen or a dart and then you want to go straight into the skin. You can use the other hand if you wish or the same hand to push on the injector button. And just you'll feel it and see it rotate as it's injected. And then once you've injected the entire solution, hold it for 10 seconds or count to 10 before removing the needle. When you're done, you want to dispose of that pen needle in a puncture proof container. A coffee can, a detergent bottle, a prescription bottle, something that's puncture proof and has a lid. You put the protective cap on and turn counterclockwise to remove the needle. Lastly you want to make sure the pen cap gets back on to protect the insulin from the light."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

First you need to gather your supplies, which would be the insulin pen itself, an alcohol swab, and the pen needle. Then you want to wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol sanitation solution. Rub your hands together until it's dry. Start by removing the cap to the pen. At this point, if you have cloudy insulin, which would include NPH insulin or a mixture thereof, you want to mix it. You mix it with your palms, like rolling it together, or you can go gently back and forth. You don't want to rigorously shake it. If you have clear insulin that does not contain NPH, then you don't have to mix. You can skip that part altogether. Use your alcohol wipe to wipe the rubber membrane on the end of the pen. And then remove the protective tab on the pen needle. Push the needle into the end of the pen and turn it clockwise to tighten it. Next you want to do what we call a safety check to make sure there's no air in the system. You'll dial the dose indicator to two units, remove the outer needle cap, and save that for later. The inner needle cap you can remove and throw away. So you've dialed to two units. You're going to push on the injector button and watch the end of the needle to make sure that you see some insulin come out. It might be a stream or it might be just drops of insulin. As long as you see liquid there, you know that there's no air in the system. Next you're going to dial the dose that's been prescribed for you. For example, if five units is my dose, I'll dial to the mark right between the four and the six. And I'm ready to give it. The preferred site for insulin administration is the abdomen. The abdomen is from your rib cage to your hips and as far laterally as you can comfortably reach. You want to rotate sites so that you're not returning to the same couple places again and again. You should be about two finger widths away from your belly button. So first expose the injection site. Hold your pen like a writing pen or a dart and then you want to go straight into the skin. You can use the other hand if you wish or the same hand to push on the injector button. And just you'll feel it and see it rotate as it's injected. And then once you've injected the entire solution, hold it for 10 seconds or count to 10 before removing the needle.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, my name is Jessica. I'm one of the Diabetes Specialist Nurses for the Aintree site. This is a demonstration video on how to administer insulin safely to your patients on the ward. So, firstly, we want to identify the correct type of needle. If you're administering insulin to a patient as a third party, safety needles must always be used. Now, on the Aintree site, we use a slightly different safety needle to the Royal and Broad green site. However, the principles of use are the exact same for them all. On the Aintree site, we use these ClickStart safety needles and on the Royal site and the Broad green site, we use Microdock needles. So, what you want to do is obviously get your insulin and ensure you're following the correct meds management policy and it's the right patient, the right time, the right medication, the right route and make sure obviously you've checked their allergies. So, what I would want to do is apply the needle. If I just come closer, you peel off the lid and you just screw it on to the end of the pen as such. So, you can see that's now attached and what I want to do is remove this clear cap. Now, you can see that the needle is not exposed to that point, it's completely covered up but you can see it through the blue cap. So, I want to make sure the needle is attached to the pen correctly. So, I'm just going to dial up a couple of units and do what we call an air shot. So, I could see that that has come out. So, I know that when I administer the dose to the patient, they are going to get the full dose because it's connected correctly. So, if my patient was on 10 units, what I want to do is dial up to the number 10 as shown. Now, the correct injection sites are the stomach, the legs and the underarms. So, you want to be injecting into the subcutaneous layer of fat and when you inject, you want to be rotating around to different sites to avoid any build up of insulin or any pockets causing any lumps or bumps. So, on here, I'll use a demonstration stomach. So, you want to be injecting onto bare skin. You don't need to clean it before, the patient should be suitably clean and what you want to do is be feeling for the area first to make sure there is no lumps and bumps deciding that that's the area you want to inject into. And then what you want to do is go in at a 90 degree angle as shown and just go directly into the skin and make sure it punctures and then all you do is gently press down on the insulin pen until it goes back down to zero. Once it's back down at zero, you count to 10. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and what you want to then do is release the needle away from the skin. So, you can see now on this safety needle that there's a cover come over the needle and this cover is red and that will stop any sharp injuries and then what you can do is remove the needle off the pen as such and pop it straight into your sharps. You never really need to worry that your patient has not received the full dose of insulin. You would see a large volume of liquid come out if they had not received it. It's perfectly normal to see a small dot of liquid next to the injection site as with any injection. It is also normal sometimes to get a small bruise or a little dot of blood. That might just be if you've hit a little blood vessel. It shouldn't cause any trouble to the patients and should go within a few days. Now, patients should not use safety needles. It's really important because they might not have the correct technique. They might not apply the right pressure which means they might not be getting the insulin as it's prescribed with the doses as it's prescribed. If patients are able to, they need to fill out the correct self-medication forms on the ward and be assessed as competent and then what they can do is administer their own insulin. So these would be the types of needles that the patients would use if they were going to administer it themselves. So you can see it looks very similar. You peel off your cap as such, screw it on to the end of the pen until it's locked in position. Take off your first cap and then your second cap and obviously you can see there this tiny little needle and obviously that's an exposed needle which is why as a healthcare professional we would never want to use that as it's very high risk of sharps to us. If patients were using it themselves, that's perfectly safe. So the same technique where they would dial up a couple of units, do an air shot, you can see that the liquid has come out there so then they would dial up to their correct dose. So they're going to be on 10 units as well and what they would do is inject again the exact same injection technique, 90 degree angle onto Clean Skin in the correct site and you just go directly in and press it down until it goes back down to zero as shown. Then count to 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We would remove it. As you can see that needle is still exposed. As it's a non-safety needle so then what the patient will need is their own little sharp spoon which should be at the end of their bed or available to them when they're administering. They can apply the cap back on and screw it off of the pen and dispose of it as such and they're sharp too. If you ever have any worries or questions or concerns regarding administering insulin please always speak to your diabetes teams on the appropriate site. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, my name is Jessica. I'm one of the Diabetes Specialist Nurses for the Aintree site. This is a demonstration video on how to administer insulin safely to your patients on the ward. So, firstly, we want to identify the correct type of needle. If you're administering insulin to a patient as a third party, safety needles must always be used. Now, on the Aintree site, we use a slightly different safety needle to the Royal and Broad green site. However, the principles of use are the exact same for them all. On the Aintree site, we use these ClickStart safety needles and on the Royal site and the Broad green site, we use Microdock needles. So, what you want to do is obviously get your insulin and ensure you're following the correct meds management policy and it's the right patient, the right time, the right medication, the right route and make sure obviously you've checked their allergies. So, what I would want to do is apply the needle. If I just come closer, you peel off the lid and you just screw it on to the end of the pen as such. So, you can see that's now attached and what I want to do is remove this clear cap. Now, you can see that the needle is not exposed to that point, it's completely covered up but you can see it through the blue cap. So, I want to make sure the needle is attached to the pen correctly. So, I'm just going to dial up a couple of units and do what we call an air shot. So, I could see that that has come out. So, I know that when I administer the dose to the patient, they are going to get the full dose because it's connected correctly. So, if my patient was on 10 units, what I want to do is dial up to the number 10 as shown. Now, the correct injection sites are the stomach, the legs and the underarms. So, you want to be injecting into the subcutaneous layer of fat and when you inject, you want to be rotating around to different sites to avoid any build up of insulin or any pockets causing any lumps or bumps. So, on here, I'll use a demonstration stomach. So, you want to be injecting onto bare skin. You don't need to clean it before, the patient should be suitably clean and what you want to do is be feeling for the area first to make sure there is no lumps and bumps deciding that that's the area you want to inject into. And then what you want to do is go in at a 90 degree angle as shown and just go directly into the skin and make sure it punctures and then all you do is gently press down on the insulin pen until it goes back down to zero. Once it's back down at zero, you count to 10. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and what you want to then do is release the needle away from the skin. So, you can see now on this safety needle that there's a cover come over the needle and this cover is red and that will stop any sharp injuries and then what you can do is remove the needle off the pen as such and pop it straight into your sharps. You never really need to worry that your patient has not received the full dose of insulin. You would see a large volume of liquid come out if they had not received it. It's perfectly normal to see a small dot of liquid next to the injection site as with any injection. It is also normal sometimes to get a small bruise or a little dot of blood. That might just be if you've hit a little blood vessel. It shouldn't cause any trouble to the patients and should go within a few days. Now, patients should not use safety needles. It's really important because they might not have the correct technique. They might not apply the right pressure which means they might not be getting the insulin as it's prescribed with the doses as it's prescribed. If patients are able to, they need to fill out the correct self-medication forms on the ward and be assessed as competent and then what they can do is administer their own insulin. So these would be the types of needles that the patients would use if they were going to administer it themselves. So you can see it looks very similar. You peel off your cap as such, screw it on to the end of the pen until it's locked in position. Take off your first cap and then your second cap and obviously you can see there this tiny little needle and obviously that's an exposed needle which is why as a healthcare professional we would never want to use that as it's very high risk of sharps to us. If patients were using it themselves, that's perfectly safe. So the same technique where they would dial up a couple of units, do an air shot, you can see that the liquid has come out there so then they would dial up to their correct dose. So they're going to be on 10 units as well and what they would do is inject again the exact same injection technique, 90 degree angle onto Clean Skin in the correct site and you just go directly in and press it down until it goes back down to zero as shown. Then count to 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We would remove it. As you can see that needle is still exposed. As it's a non-safety needle so then what the patient will need is their own little sharp spoon which should be at the end of their bed or available to them when they're administering. They can apply the cap back on and screw it off of the pen and dispose of it as such and they're sharp too. If you ever have any worries or questions or concerns regarding administering insulin please always speak to your diabetes teams on the appropriate site. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Once it's back down at zero, you count to 10. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and what you want to then do is release the needle away from the skin. So, you can see now on this safety needle that there's a cover come over the needle and this cover is red and that will stop any sharp injuries and then what you can do is remove the needle off the pen as such and pop it straight into your sharps. You never really need to worry that your patient has not received the full dose of insulin. You would see a large volume of liquid come out if they had not received it. It's perfectly normal to see a small dot of liquid next to the injection site as with any injection. It is also normal sometimes to get a small bruise or a little dot of blood. That might just be if you've hit a little blood vessel. It shouldn't cause any trouble to the patients and should go within a few days. Now, patients should not use safety needles. It's really important because they might not have the correct technique. They might not apply the right pressure which means they might not be getting the insulin as it's prescribed with the doses as it's prescribed. If patients are able to, they need to fill out the correct self-medication forms on the ward and be assessed as competent and then what they can do is administer their own insulin. So these would be the types of needles that the patients would use if they were going to administer it themselves. So you can see it looks very similar. You peel off your cap as such, screw it on to the end of the pen until it's locked in position. Take off your first cap and then your second cap and obviously you can see there this tiny little needle and obviously that's an exposed needle which is why as a healthcare professional we would never want to use that as it's very high risk of sharps to us. If patients were using it themselves, that's perfectly safe. So the same technique where they would dial up a couple of units, do an air shot, you can see that the liquid has come out there so then they would dial up to their correct dose. So they're going to be on 10 units as well and what they would do is inject again the exact same injection technique, 90 degree angle onto Clean Skin in the correct site and you just go directly in and press it down until it goes back down to zero as shown. Then count to 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We would remove it. As you can see that needle is still exposed. As it's a non-safety needle so then what the patient will need is their own little sharp spoon which should be at the end of their bed or available to them when they're administering. They can apply the cap back on and screw it off of the pen and dispose of it as such and they're sharp too. If you ever have any worries or questions or concerns regarding administering insulin please always speak to your diabetes teams on the appropriate site. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

This is a demonstration video on how to administer insulin safely to your patients on the ward. So, firstly, we want to identify the correct type of needle. If you're administering insulin to a patient as a third party, safety needles must always be used. Now, on the Aintree site, we use a slightly different safety needle to the Royal and Broad green site. However, the principles of use are the exact same for them all. On the Aintree site, we use these ClickStart safety needles and on the Royal site and the Broad green site, we use Microdock needles. So, what you want to do is obviously get your insulin and ensure you're following the correct meds management policy and it's the right patient, the right time, the right medication, the right route and make sure obviously you've checked their allergies. So, what I would want to do is apply the needle. If I just come closer, you peel off the lid and you just screw it on to the end of the pen as such. So, you can see that's now attached and what I want to do is remove this clear cap. Now, you can see that the needle is not exposed to that point, it's completely covered up but you can see it through the blue cap. So, I want to make sure the needle is attached to the pen correctly. So, I'm just going to dial up a couple of units and do what we call an air shot. So, I could see that that has come out. So, I know that when I administer the dose to the patient, they are going to get the full dose because it's connected correctly. So, if my patient was on 10 units, what I want to do is dial up to the number 10 as shown. Now, the correct injection sites are the stomach, the legs and the underarms. So, you want to be injecting into the subcutaneous layer of fat and when you inject, you want to be rotating around to different sites to avoid any build up of insulin or any pockets causing any lumps or bumps. So, on here, I'll use a demonstration stomach. So, you want to be injecting onto bare skin. You don't need to clean it before, the patient should be suitably clean and what you want to do is be feeling for the area first to make sure there is no lumps and bumps deciding that that's the area you want to inject into. And then what you want to do is go in at a 90 degree angle as shown and just go directly into the skin and make sure it punctures and then all you do is gently press down on the insulin pen until it goes back down to zero.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, my name is Jessica. I'm one of the Diabetes Specialist Nurses for the Aintree site. This is a demonstration video on how to administer insulin safely to your patients on the ward. So, firstly, we want to identify the correct type of needle. If you're administering insulin to a patient as a third party, safety needles must always be used. Now, on the Aintree site, we use a slightly different safety needle to the Royal and Broad green site. However, the principles of use are the exact same for them all. On the Aintree site, we use these ClickStart safety needles and on the Royal site and the Broad green site, we use Microdock needles. So, what you want to do is obviously get your insulin and ensure you're following the correct meds management policy and it's the right patient, the right time, the right medication, the right route and make sure obviously you've checked their allergies. So, what I would want to do is apply the needle. If I just come closer, you peel off the lid and you just screw it on to the end of the pen as such. So, you can see that's now attached and what I want to do is remove this clear cap. Now, you can see that the needle is not exposed to that point, it's completely covered up but you can see it through the blue cap. So, I want to make sure the needle is attached to the pen correctly. So, I'm just going to dial up a couple of units and do what we call an air shot. So, I could see that that has come out. So, I know that when I administer the dose to the patient, they are going to get the full dose because it's connected correctly. So, if my patient was on 10 units, what I want to do is dial up to the number 10 as shown. Now, the correct injection sites are the stomach, the legs and the underarms. So, you want to be injecting into the subcutaneous layer of fat and when you inject, you want to be rotating around to different sites to avoid any build up of insulin or any pockets causing any lumps or bumps. So, on here, I'll use a demonstration stomach. So, you want to be injecting onto bare skin. You don't need to clean it before, the patient should be suitably clean and what you want to do is be feeling for the area first to make sure there is no lumps and bumps deciding that that's the area you want to inject into. And then what you want to do is go in at a 90 degree angle as shown and just go directly into the skin and make sure it punctures and then all you do is gently press down on the insulin pen until it goes back down to zero. Once it's back down at zero, you count to 10. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and what you want to then do is release the needle away from the skin. So, you can see now on this safety needle that there's a cover come over the needle and this cover is red and that will stop any sharp injuries and then what you can do is remove the needle off the pen as such and pop it straight into your sharps. You never really need to worry that your patient has not received the full dose of insulin. You would see a large volume of liquid come out if they had not received it. It's perfectly normal to see a small dot of liquid next to the injection site as with any injection. It is also normal sometimes to get a small bruise or a little dot of blood. That might just be if you've hit a little blood vessel. It shouldn't cause any trouble to the patients and should go within a few days. Now, patients should not use safety needles. It's really important because they might not have the correct technique. They might not apply the right pressure which means they might not be getting the insulin as it's prescribed with the doses as it's prescribed. If patients are able to, they need to fill out the correct self-medication forms on the ward and be assessed as competent and then what they can do is administer their own insulin. So these would be the types of needles that the patients would use if they were going to administer it themselves. So you can see it looks very similar. You peel off your cap as such, screw it on to the end of the pen until it's locked in position. Take off your first cap and then your second cap and obviously you can see there this tiny little needle and obviously that's an exposed needle which is why as a healthcare professional we would never want to use that as it's very high risk of sharps to us. If patients were using it themselves, that's perfectly safe. So the same technique where they would dial up a couple of units, do an air shot, you can see that the liquid has come out there so then they would dial up to their correct dose. So they're going to be on 10 units as well and what they would do is inject again the exact same injection technique, 90 degree angle onto Clean Skin in the correct site and you just go directly in and press it down until it goes back down to zero as shown. Then count to 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We would remove it. As you can see that needle is still exposed. As it's a non-safety needle so then what the patient will need is their own little sharp spoon which should be at the end of their bed or available to them when they're administering. They can apply the cap back on and screw it off of the pen and dispose of it as such and they're sharp too.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: So where are the places that I can inject the insulin? So insulin can be injected in several different places. The most common place where you see people inject is actually in their abdomen. And when you go to the abdomen for a place to inject insulin, you want people to stay two fingers away from the belly button, because it's very sensitive there, and stay below the rib cage, but above the pelvis bone. So you can go from this side all the way across to this side. Another place to inject insulin is the arm, and it's the outer area of the arm back here. You want the insulin to go into the fat tissue. So we don't want it to go into the front of the arm here, where it has big blood vessels and it has more muscle, and we don't want it too close to the elbow. So you put one hand over the elbow, one hand over the shoulder. We don't want it to go into the muscle area here. So if I was measuring with you, I put one hand over the shoulder, one hand over the elbow, draw a line down the center, and I'm going to use the back part of your arm here. This back part right there. Insulin can also be injected into the leg, the thigh area. Again, I put one hand over my knee, one hand over my hip, pretend you see a crease in your pants, and you go to the outside part of your leg, not the inside part of the leg. Even though there's lots of flesh you can pinch up on the inside part of the leg, there's too many blood vessels there, and there's too many nerve endings there. It's not the best place. So you always go to the outside part of the leg. Additionally, there's some people who inject insulin into the buttock area back here, so that can be used as well, this buttock area. However, it's very awkward to reach that spot as it is with this. It can be awkward to put it in. If I was to use my arm as an area where I did want to do it myself, I'm using an insulin pen. One strategy would be to put my arm on the top of a chair and then roll my arm forward. And now this is nice and tight, just as if I was pinching it myself, and I could put the insulin in like that. Why is it that we don't want it to go into the muscle or close to the blood vessels? Because each of these insulins works for a specific time, and when we put the insulin into the fat area, what happens is we get that expected action of the insulin. Whereas if we put it into muscle tissue, muscle tissue has more blood vessels running through it, and the more exercise a person does increases that blood flow, which then will change the absorption of the insulin. And when you put it into fat tissue, we get a much more consistent, expected, predictable absorption of the insulin. So if I was to use this pen device, and I was going to inject myself, so I would have my insulin all ready to go, and in this case there's no actual insulin in here, what I would do is I'd get my pen ready, I'd have my dose ready, and I would select my area where I want to inject the insulin, and I want to pinch the skin up and the fat up so that I can pull it away from that fat tissue. For this pen, I'm going to put the needle straight in. When I put the needle in, I can let go of the pinch, and I can push to dispense the insulin. I'm at zero now, so I'm going to leave the needle in here for a count of six seconds so that all the insulin can get absorbed. One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand, six one thousand. And now I'm going to pull the needle straight out again. Was it painful? No, I felt a little poke, but it didn't hurt. So for those of us who are afraid of the needle, is there a trick to building up courage to use it? That's a common question, and most people, I'd say 99% of the people who take an insulin injection, they'll tell me the needle poke for their finger blood testing actually hurts more than does this particular needle. So it doesn't matter if you go the needle in quickly or the needle in slowly, you can do either or. One way is not better than the other. You can put the needle in and then push the plunger down until all the insulin is being given, and then pull the needle out. For people who are super cautious of the insulin and what it might feel like to poke the needle in, some people I've advised they might try using an ice cube on their skin. And the ice cube, if they rub it there first, it tends to make the skin cold and a little bit cool, and so then they can poke the needle in and they tend not to feel it. Should I clean the spot where I'm going to inject the needle into? No, you don't actually need to use an alcohol wipe on your skin first. Every time when you use a brand new insulin needle, that needle is completely... ...sterile. ...sterile, and your skin, as long as you've been showering regularly and have clean skin, then you're not going to get an infection there. Times when you might want to use an alcohol wipe is maybe we're out camping and you can't have a fresh shower every day, you might want to use an alcohol wipe then. If somebody was immunosuppressed, say they're on steroids or they're on anti-rejection drugs, they might choose to use an alcohol wipe first. But there's no data that actually shows by using an alcohol wipe that you're actually preventing infections on your skin from an insulin injection at the time. If people are in the hospital, because there can be a number of bacteria and infections around, nurses will often use an alcohol wipe in that situation, but for home use, an alcohol wipe is not necessary."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

So you always go to the outside part of the leg. Additionally, there's some people who inject insulin into the buttock area back here, so that can be used as well, this buttock area. However, it's very awkward to reach that spot as it is with this. It can be awkward to put it in. If I was to use my arm as an area where I did want to do it myself, I'm using an insulin pen. One strategy would be to put my arm on the top of a chair and then roll my arm forward. And now this is nice and tight, just as if I was pinching it myself, and I could put the insulin in like that. Why is it that we don't want it to go into the muscle or close to the blood vessels? Because each of these insulins works for a specific time, and when we put the insulin into the fat area, what happens is we get that expected action of the insulin. Whereas if we put it into muscle tissue, muscle tissue has more blood vessels running through it, and the more exercise a person does increases that blood flow, which then will change the absorption of the insulin. And when you put it into fat tissue, we get a much more consistent, expected, predictable absorption of the insulin. So if I was to use this pen device, and I was going to inject myself, so I would have my insulin all ready to go, and in this case there's no actual insulin in here, what I would do is I'd get my pen ready, I'd have my dose ready, and I would select my area where I want to inject the insulin, and I want to pinch the skin up and the fat up so that I can pull it away from that fat tissue. For this pen, I'm going to put the needle straight in. When I put the needle in, I can let go of the pinch, and I can push to dispense the insulin. I'm at zero now, so I'm going to leave the needle in here for a count of six seconds so that all the insulin can get absorbed. One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand, six one thousand. And now I'm going to pull the needle straight out again. Was it painful? No, I felt a little poke, but it didn't hurt. So for those of us who are afraid of the needle, is there a trick to building up courage to use it? That's a common question, and most people, I'd say 99% of the people who take an insulin injection, they'll tell me the needle poke for their finger blood testing actually hurts more than does this particular needle. So it doesn't matter if you go the needle in quickly or the needle in slowly, you can do either or. One way is not better than the other. You can put the needle in and then push the plunger down until all the insulin is being given, and then pull the needle out. For people who are super cautious of the insulin and what it might feel like to poke the needle in, some people I've advised they might try using an ice cube on their skin. And the ice cube, if they rub it there first, it tends to make the skin cold and a little bit cool, and so then they can poke the needle in and they tend not to feel it. Should I clean the spot where I'm going to inject the needle into? No, you don't actually need to use an alcohol wipe on your skin first. Every time when you use a brand new insulin needle, that needle is completely... ...sterile. ...sterile, and your skin, as long as you've been showering regularly and have clean skin, then you're not going to get an infection there. Times when you might want to use an alcohol wipe is maybe we're out camping and you can't have a fresh shower every day, you might want to use an alcohol wipe then. If somebody was immunosuppressed, say they're on steroids or they're on anti-rejection drugs, they might choose to use an alcohol wipe first. But there's no data that actually shows by using an alcohol wipe that you're actually preventing infections on your skin from an insulin injection at the time. If people are in the hospital, because there can be a number of bacteria and infections around, nurses will often use an alcohol wipe in that situation, but for home use, an alcohol wipe is not necessary."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

The most common place where you see people inject is actually in their abdomen.

One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand, six one thousand. And now I'm going to pull the needle straight out again. Was it painful? No, I felt a little poke, but it didn't hurt. So for those of us who are afraid of the needle, is there a trick to building up courage to use it? That's a common question, and most people, I'd say 99% of the people who take an insulin injection, they'll tell me the needle poke for their finger blood testing actually hurts more than does this particular needle. So it doesn't matter if you go the needle in quickly or the needle in slowly, you can do either or. One way is not better than the other. You can put the needle in and then push the plunger down until all the insulin is being given, and then pull the needle out. For people who are super cautious of the insulin and what it might feel like to poke the needle in, some people I've advised they might try using an ice cube on their skin. And the ice cube, if they rub it there first, it tends to make the skin cold and a little bit cool, and so then they can poke the needle in and they tend not to feel it. Should I clean the spot where I'm going to inject the needle into? No, you don't actually need to use an alcohol wipe on your skin first.

But there's no data that actually shows by using an alcohol wipe that you're actually preventing infections on your skin from an insulin injection at the time. If people are in the hospital, because there can be a number of bacteria and infections around, nurses will often use an alcohol wipe in that situation, but for home use, an alcohol wipe is not necessary."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: So where are the places that I can inject the insulin? So insulin can be injected in several different places. The most common place where you see people inject is actually in their abdomen. And when you go to the abdomen for a place to inject insulin, you want people to stay two fingers away from the belly button, because it's very sensitive there, and stay below the rib cage, but above the pelvis bone. So you can go from this side all the way across to this side. Another place to inject insulin is the arm, and it's the outer area of the arm back here. You want the insulin to go into the fat tissue. So we don't want it to go into the front of the arm here, where it has big blood vessels and it has more muscle, and we don't want it too close to the elbow. So you put one hand over the elbow, one hand over the shoulder. We don't want it to go into the muscle area here. So if I was measuring with you, I put one hand over the shoulder, one hand over the elbow, draw a line down the center, and I'm going to use the back part of your arm here. This back part right there. Insulin can also be injected into the leg, the thigh area. Again, I put one hand over my knee, one hand over my hip, pretend you see a crease in your pants, and you go to the outside part of your leg, not the inside part of the leg. Even though there's lots of flesh you can pinch up on the inside part of the leg, there's too many blood vessels there, and there's too many nerve endings there. It's not the best place. So you always go to the outside part of the leg. Additionally, there's some people who inject insulin into the buttock area back here, so that can be used as well, this buttock area. However, it's very awkward to reach that spot as it is with this. It can be awkward to put it in. If I was to use my arm as an area where I did want to do it myself, I'm using an insulin pen. One strategy would be to put my arm on the top of a chair and then roll my arm forward. And now this is nice and tight, just as if I was pinching it myself, and I could put the insulin in like that. Why is it that we don't want it to go into the muscle or close to the blood vessels? Because each of these insulins works for a specific time, and when we put the insulin into the fat area, what happens is we get that expected action of the insulin. Whereas if we put it into muscle tissue, muscle tissue has more blood vessels running through it, and the more exercise a person does increases that blood flow, which then will change the absorption of the insulin. And when you put it into fat tissue, we get a much more consistent, expected, predictable absorption of the insulin. So if I was to use this pen device, and I was going to inject myself, so I would have my insulin all ready to go, and in this case there's no actual insulin in here, what I would do is I'd get my pen ready, I'd have my dose ready, and I would select my area where I want to inject the insulin, and I want to pinch the skin up and the fat up so that I can pull it away from that fat tissue.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: So where are the places that I can inject the insulin? So insulin can be injected in several different places. The most common place where you see people inject is actually in their abdomen. And when you go to the abdomen for a place to inject insulin, you want people to stay two fingers away from the belly button, because it's very sensitive there, and stay below the rib cage, but above the pelvis bone. So you can go from this side all the way across to this side. Another place to inject insulin is the arm, and it's the outer area of the arm back here. You want the insulin to go into the fat tissue. So we don't want it to go into the front of the arm here, where it has big blood vessels and it has more muscle, and we don't want it too close to the elbow. So you put one hand over the elbow, one hand over the shoulder. We don't want it to go into the muscle area here. So if I was measuring with you, I put one hand over the shoulder, one hand over the elbow, draw a line down the center, and I'm going to use the back part of your arm here. This back part right there. Insulin can also be injected into the leg, the thigh area. Again, I put one hand over my knee, one hand over my hip, pretend you see a crease in your pants, and you go to the outside part of your leg, not the inside part of the leg. Even though there's lots of flesh you can pinch up on the inside part of the leg, there's too many blood vessels there, and there's too many nerve endings there. It's not the best place. So you always go to the outside part of the leg. Additionally, there's some people who inject insulin into the buttock area back here, so that can be used as well, this buttock area. However, it's very awkward to reach that spot as it is with this. It can be awkward to put it in. If I was to use my arm as an area where I did want to do it myself, I'm using an insulin pen. One strategy would be to put my arm on the top of a chair and then roll my arm forward. And now this is nice and tight, just as if I was pinching it myself, and I could put the insulin in like that. Why is it that we don't want it to go into the muscle or close to the blood vessels? Because each of these insulins works for a specific time, and when we put the insulin into the fat area, what happens is we get that expected action of the insulin. Whereas if we put it into muscle tissue, muscle tissue has more blood vessels running through it, and the more exercise a person does increases that blood flow, which then will change the absorption of the insulin. And when you put it into fat tissue, we get a much more consistent, expected, predictable absorption of the insulin. So if I was to use this pen device, and I was going to inject myself, so I would have my insulin all ready to go, and in this case there's no actual insulin in here, what I would do is I'd get my pen ready, I'd have my dose ready, and I would select my area where I want to inject the insulin, and I want to pinch the skin up and the fat up so that I can pull it away from that fat tissue. For this pen, I'm going to put the needle straight in. When I put the needle in, I can let go of the pinch, and I can push to dispense the insulin. I'm at zero now, so I'm going to leave the needle in here for a count of six seconds so that all the insulin can get absorbed. One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand, six one thousand. And now I'm going to pull the needle straight out again. Was it painful? No, I felt a little poke, but it didn't hurt. So for those of us who are afraid of the needle, is there a trick to building up courage to use it? That's a common question, and most people, I'd say 99% of the people who take an insulin injection, they'll tell me the needle poke for their finger blood testing actually hurts more than does this particular needle. So it doesn't matter if you go the needle in quickly or the needle in slowly, you can do either or. One way is not better than the other. You can put the needle in and then push the plunger down until all the insulin is being given, and then pull the needle out. For people who are super cautious of the insulin and what it might feel like to poke the needle in, some people I've advised they might try using an ice cube on their skin. And the ice cube, if they rub it there first, it tends to make the skin cold and a little bit cool, and so then they can poke the needle in and they tend not to feel it. Should I clean the spot where I'm going to inject the needle into? No, you don't actually need to use an alcohol wipe on your skin first. Every time when you use a brand new insulin needle, that needle is completely... ...sterile. ...sterile, and your skin, as long as you've been showering regularly and have clean skin, then you're not going to get an infection there. Times when you might want to use an alcohol wipe is maybe we're out camping and you can't have a fresh shower every day, you might want to use an alcohol wipe then. If somebody was immunosuppressed, say they're on steroids or they're on anti-rejection drugs, they might choose to use an alcohol wipe first. But there's no data that actually shows by using an alcohol wipe that you're actually preventing infections on your skin from an insulin injection at the time.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: What's going on guys? I wanted to jump in today and as you know I've been MDI for a couple weeks now and I wanted to give you guys a little review on the InPen that I've been using. Actually, not really a review. This is more of an instructional video. So this is the InPen created by Companion Medical and no, it is not sponsored by them because I wanted to make sure this is an unbiased video series, right? So everything is my own words. I'm going to tell you how you can change out the cartridges. So you can see that there. If it focuses, boop. Come on, focus, focus, focus. There we go. So you need cartridges if you want to be using these things and it's very similar to an insulin pen, like a Humalog pen that I used to use when I was first diagnosed. But I didn't know how to change out the cartridge my first time and so I had to look it up on YouTube and so I'm making a YouTube video. What's up? The interesting thing I want to note about these things that InPen could really improve upon is there's no way to tell when it's actually going to end. So you can see there, hopefully, this is an empty cartridge. You can see that red line. It's kind of a guessing game where we have this red line. It's like, okay, there's probably maybe five units left, but here's the thing. This one ran out halfway through a breakfast dose. So I had to go figure out how to change the cartridge real quick, go change it, and then go deliver the rest of my dose with the new cartridge. So InPen, if you're listening, I would love to have that feature added somehow. But outside of that awesome little tool we have. And so what I want to show you first off is that red line right there is how you know when the insulin is going to run out. That's the only indicator you have. So you kind of have to eyeball it. But when the time does come, very simple to take this out. So what you're going to do, you have the InPen here, right? Mine's blue. Take off the cap, chuck it. Just kidding. Put it somewhere safe. You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose. Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right? Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

So I had to go figure out how to change the cartridge real quick, go change it, and then go deliver the rest of my dose with the new cartridge. So InPen, if you're listening, I would love to have that feature added somehow. But outside of that awesome little tool we have. And so what I want to show you first off is that red line right there is how you know when the insulin is going to run out. That's the only indicator you have. So you kind of have to eyeball it. But when the time does come, very simple to take this out. So what you're going to do, you have the InPen here, right? Mine's blue. Take off the cap, chuck it. Just kidding. Put it somewhere safe. You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose. Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right? Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

And so what I want to show you first off is that red line right there is how you know when the insulin is going to run out. That's the only indicator you have. So you kind of have to eyeball it. But when the time does come, very simple to take this out. So what you're going to do, you have the InPen here, right? Mine's blue. Take off the cap, chuck it. Just kidding. Put it somewhere safe. You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose. Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right? Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

I wanted to jump in today and as you know I've been MDI for a couple weeks now and I wanted to give you guys a little review on the InPen that I've been using. Actually, not really a review. This is more of an instructional video. So this is the InPen created by Companion Medical and no, it is not sponsored by them because I wanted to make sure this is an unbiased video series, right? So everything is my own words. I'm going to tell you how you can change out the cartridges. So you can see that there. If it focuses, boop. Come on, focus, focus, focus. There we go. So you need cartridges if you want to be using these things and it's very similar to an insulin pen, like a Humalog pen that I used to use when I was first diagnosed. But I didn't know how to change out the cartridge my first time and so I had to look it up on YouTube and so I'm making a YouTube video. What's up? The interesting thing I want to note about these things that InPen could really improve upon is there's no way to tell when it's actually going to end. So you can see there, hopefully, this is an empty cartridge. You can see that red line. It's kind of a guessing game where we have this red line. It's like, okay, there's probably maybe five units left, but here's the thing. This one ran out halfway through a breakfast dose.

You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose. Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right? Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

It's like, okay, there's probably maybe five units left, but here's the thing. This one ran out halfway through a breakfast dose. So I had to go figure out how to change the cartridge real quick, go change it, and then go deliver the rest of my dose with the new cartridge.

Rate the following Transcript according to this question:\nQuestion: Are the aims of the video clear?\nReturn an integer score from 1 to 5, where 1 means 'no', 3 means 'partially', and 5 means 'yes'. Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Perhaps the most scariest part for me having to come to the realization that I would have to start injecting insulin. It was more so the fear of the unknown for me. When you have gestational diabetes, your diabetes care team may prescribe insulin to help you reach your blood glucose goals. Some women who inject insulin use an insulin pen. Keep in mind that there are several different pens to choose from, and each will have its own special instructions. Work with your diabetes care team to find the pen that works best for you, and learn how to use it to make sure you take your prescribed dose. Once I was educated, it became a little bit easier to deal with, so I was able to cope. At first glance, the insulin pen looks a lot like a writing pen, but it has a needle instead of a writing point, and an insulin cartridge rather than an ink cartridge. The following step-by-step preparation method can be used with most insulin pens. Gather your supplies. They include your pen, needle, alcohol swab, and a sharps container. Wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry them. Pull the outer cap of the pen off. Wipe the rubber seal at the top with alcohol. Get the needle and take the protective paper tab off. Screw the needle onto the pen tightly. You'll notice that it's still in its protective cap. Remove the outer needle cap. Take off the inner needle cap. It is important to prime your pen before each injection to help ensure your proper dose. To prime your pen, dial your pen to deliver two units of insulin by turning the dose knob until you see a two in the window. Point the pen straight up and push the injection button. You should see insulin come out of the needle tip. Your pen is now primed and you can set your dose. Turn the knob until your dose appears in the window. If you're using cloudy insulin, roll the pen between your hands and tip the pen end to end to mix at least 15 to 20 times. Now you're ready to inject your insulin. Insulin should be injected into fatty tissue. The recommended injection areas are the abdomen or belly, the backs of the arms, the tops or sides of the thigh, and the buttocks or rear. With some insulins, where you inject on your body can make a difference in how fast the insulin will go to work or its onset. Work with your diabetes care team to find the injection area that is best for you.

To begin, take off the pen cap. Check the appearance of your insulin. The insulin should be clear. Do not use if the insulin solution is cloudy or coloured. Each pen contains 300 units of insulin. You can set those from 1 to 60 units in the step of 1. Wipe the rubber seal with alcohol. Remove the protective seal from new needle. Line up the needle with the pen and keep it straight as you attach. If the needle is not kept straight, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage or break the needle. So it's important to keep it straight as you screw or push depending on the needle type. Before using the pen, it's very important to check the pen is working well and to remove all air bubbles. To do this, select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. Take off the outer needle cap to reuse and take off the inner needle cap and discard it. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rises up. Press the injection button and check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test 2 more times. If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. Make sure the dose window shows 0 after the safety test. To begin the injection process, turn the dosage selector in order to set the required dose. Do not push the injection button while turning as this will cause the insulin to come out. Hold the Dyspo pen within your palm and fingers as you see. Slowly insert the needle into the skin. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button. The number in the dose window will return to 0. Keep the injection button pressed for 10 seconds before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose is delivered. Make sure after injection the number in the dose window will return to 0. Place the outer cover and screw and remove the pin from the pen. Dispose the needle safely in a sharps container. Always put the pen cap back and store the pen until your next injection in a cool and dry place."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

To do this, select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. Take off the outer needle cap to reuse and take off the inner needle cap and discard it. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rises up. Press the injection button and check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test 2 more times. If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. Make sure the dose window shows 0 after the safety test. To begin the injection process, turn the dosage selector in order to set the required dose. Do not push the injection button while turning as this will cause the insulin to come out. Hold the Dyspo pen within your palm and fingers as you see. Slowly insert the needle into the skin. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button. The number in the dose window will return to 0. Keep the injection button pressed for 10 seconds before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose is delivered. Make sure after injection the number in the dose window will return to 0. Place the outer cover and screw and remove the pin from the pen. Dispose the needle safely in a sharps container. Always put the pen cap back and store the pen until your next injection in a cool and dry place."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test 2 more times. If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. Make sure the dose window shows 0 after the safety test. To begin the injection process, turn the dosage selector in order to set the required dose. Do not push the injection button while turning as this will cause the insulin to come out. Hold the Dyspo pen within your palm and fingers as you see. Slowly insert the needle into the skin. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button. The number in the dose window will return to 0. Keep the injection button pressed for 10 seconds before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose is delivered. Make sure after injection the number in the dose window will return to 0. Place the outer cover and screw and remove the pin from the pen. Dispose the needle safely in a sharps container. Always put the pen cap back and store the pen until your next injection in a cool and dry place."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

The first step in insulin administration is to gather all of the items we will need together. These items include the insulin vial, a syringe, and an alcohol wipe. In the first step, take off the cap and leave the gray stopper in place. Wipe off the top of the vial with the alcohol swab. Now take the syringe, remove the orange cap, and draw air into it equal to the dose of insulin that you will be injecting. In this example, we will be using 20 units. Pull back the plunger until the end of the black stopper rests just below the unit level of 20 on the syringe. Next, push the syringe through the stopper and inject the air into the vial. Air is injected into the vial because this makes it easier to draw up the insulin, especially as the vial nears completion. Keep the syringe in the bottle and turn both upside down, making sure the tip of the needle is well within the insulin in the vial. Then pull the plunger back until you have the correct dose of insulin. Take a look inside the syringe. If you see any air bubbles, tap the syringe gently until the bubbles rise to the top. Then slowly inject the air back into the insulin vial. When this is done, redraw the correct dose of insulin. If you wish, clean off the injection site with the alcohol swab. If you do this, allow the alcohol to dry before you inject the insulin. Next, lightly pinch a fold of skin. Then insert the needle straight into the fold as illustrated here. Push the plunger slowly to inject a full dose of insulin and wait about 10 seconds before pulling the needle straight out. That's it! Now you can feel confident in your ability to self-administer insulin. Follow your pharmacist's instructions regarding the appropriate disposition of the used needle."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Pull back the plunger until the end of the black stopper rests just below the unit level of 20 on the syringe. Next, push the syringe through the stopper and inject the air into the vial. Air is injected into the vial because this makes it easier to draw up the insulin, especially as the vial nears completion. Keep the syringe in the bottle and turn both upside down, making sure the tip of the needle is well within the insulin in the vial. Then pull the plunger back until you have the correct dose of insulin. Take a look inside the syringe. If you see any air bubbles, tap the syringe gently until the bubbles rise to the top. Then slowly inject the air back into the insulin vial. When this is done, redraw the correct dose of insulin. If you wish, clean off the injection site with the alcohol swab. If you do this, allow the alcohol to dry before you inject the insulin. Next, lightly pinch a fold of skin. Then insert the needle straight into the fold as illustrated here. Push the plunger slowly to inject a full dose of insulin and wait about 10 seconds before pulling the needle straight out. That's it! Now you can feel confident in your ability to self-administer insulin. Follow your pharmacist's instructions regarding the appropriate disposition of the used needle."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

The first step in insulin administration is to gather all of the items we will need together. These items include the insulin vial, a syringe, and an alcohol wipe. In the first step, take off the cap and leave the gray stopper in place. Wipe off the top of the vial with the alcohol swab. Now take the syringe, remove the orange cap, and draw air into it equal to the dose of insulin that you will be injecting. In this example, we will be using 20 units.
