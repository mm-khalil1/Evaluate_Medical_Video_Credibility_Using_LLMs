Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: What's going on guys? I wanted to jump in today and as you know I've been MDI for a couple weeks now and I wanted to give you guys a little review on the InPen that I've been using. Actually, not really a review. This is more of an instructional video. So this is the InPen created by Companion Medical and no, it is not sponsored by them because I wanted to make sure this is an unbiased video series, right? So everything is my own words. I'm going to tell you how you can change out the cartridges. So you can see that there. If it focuses, boop. Come on, focus, focus, focus. There we go. So you need cartridges if you want to be using these things and it's very similar to an insulin pen, like a Humalog pen that I used to use when I was first diagnosed. But I didn't know how to change out the cartridge my first time and so I had to look it up on YouTube and so I'm making a YouTube video. What's up? The interesting thing I want to note about these things that InPen could really improve upon is there's no way to tell when it's actually going to end. So you can see there, hopefully, this is an empty cartridge. You can see that red line. It's kind of a guessing game where we have this red line. It's like, okay, there's probably maybe five units left, but here's the thing. This one ran out halfway through a breakfast dose. So I had to go figure out how to change the cartridge real quick, go change it, and then go deliver the rest of my dose with the new cartridge. So InPen, if you're listening, I would love to have that feature added somehow. But outside of that awesome little tool we have. And so what I want to show you first off is that red line right there is how you know when the insulin is going to run out. That's the only indicator you have. So you kind of have to eyeball it. But when the time does come, very simple to take this out. So what you're going to do, you have the InPen here, right? Mine's blue. Take off the cap, chuck it. Just kidding. Put it somewhere safe. You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose. Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right? Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

We've got journals and programs and coaching, and it is the best chance you have at running this thing on autopilot.

I wanted to jump in today and as you know I've been MDI for a couple weeks now and I wanted to give you guys a little review on the InPen that I've been using. Actually, not really a review. This is more of an instructional video. So this is the InPen created by Companion Medical and no, it is not sponsored by them because I wanted to make sure this is an unbiased video series, right? So everything is my own words. I'm going to tell you how you can change out the cartridges. So you can see that there. If it focuses, boop. Come on, focus, focus, focus. There we go. So you need cartridges if you want to be using these things and it's very similar to an insulin pen, like a Humalog pen that I used to use when I was first diagnosed. But I didn't know how to change out the cartridge my first time and so I had to look it up on YouTube and so I'm making a YouTube video. What's up? The interesting thing I want to note about these things that InPen could really improve upon is there's no way to tell when it's actually going to end. So you can see there, hopefully, this is an empty cartridge. You can see that red line. It's kind of a guessing game where we have this red line. It's like, okay, there's probably maybe five units left, but here's the thing. This one ran out halfway through a breakfast dose. So I had to go figure out how to change the cartridge real quick, go change it, and then go deliver the rest of my dose with the new cartridge. So InPen, if you're listening, I would love to have that feature added somehow. But outside of that awesome little tool we have. And so what I want to show you first off is that red line right there is how you know when the insulin is going to run out. That's the only indicator you have. So you kind of have to eyeball it. But when the time does come, very simple to take this out. So what you're going to do, you have the InPen here, right? Mine's blue. Take off the cap, chuck it. Just kidding. Put it somewhere safe. You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose. Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right? Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

We've got journals and programs and coaching, and it is the best chance you have at running this thing on autopilot.

It was more so the fear of the unknown for me. When you have gestational diabetes, your diabetes care team may prescribe insulin to help you reach your blood glucose goals. Some women who inject insulin use an insulin pen. Keep in mind that there are several different pens to choose from, and each will have its own special instructions. Work with your diabetes care team to find the pen that works best for you, and learn how to use it to make sure you take your prescribed dose. Once I was educated, it became a little bit easier to deal with, so I was able to cope. At first glance, the insulin pen looks a lot like a writing pen, but it has a needle instead of a writing point, and an insulin cartridge rather than an ink cartridge. The following step-by-step preparation method can be used with most insulin pens. Gather your supplies. They include your pen, needle, alcohol swab, and a sharps container. Wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry them. Pull the outer cap of the pen off. Wipe the rubber seal at the top with alcohol. Get the needle and take the protective paper tab off. Screw the needle onto the pen tightly. You'll notice that it's still in its protective cap. Remove the outer needle cap. Take off the inner needle cap. It is important to prime your pen before each injection to help ensure your proper dose. To prime your pen, dial your pen to deliver two units of insulin by turning the dose knob until you see a two in the window. Point the pen straight up and push the injection button. You should see insulin come out of the needle tip. Your pen is now primed and you can set your dose. Turn the knob until your dose appears in the window. If you're using cloudy insulin, roll the pen between your hands and tip the pen end to end to mix at least 15 to 20 times. Now you're ready to inject your insulin. Insulin should be injected into fatty tissue. The recommended injection areas are the abdomen or belly, the backs of the arms, the tops or sides of the thigh, and the buttocks or rear. With some insulins, where you inject on your body can make a difference in how fast the insulin will go to work or its onset. Work with your diabetes care team to find the injection area that is best for you. Try to use the same area at the same time every day, but you should change the actual injection site each time you inject. This helps keep your skin and underlying tissues healthy. When injecting into your abdomen, make sure to stay two inches away from any scar tissue or your navel. Once you have selected an injection site, wipe the skin with alcohol and wait a few seconds for it to dry. Push the needle in at a 90 degree angle and push the injection button firmly and smoothly. Depending on the pen you use, you may need to wait five to ten seconds before pulling the pen straight out. Remove the needle and discard it properly in a sharps container, which you can get from your local pharmacy or other supplier of diabetes products. If you don't have a sharps container, a heavy plastic bottle with a tight-fitting lid clearly labeled that it contains medical waste will work too. In some areas, you are asked not to put filled sharps containers in your regular trash for collection. Your diabetes care team can tell you if your community has a specific place to take your sharps container when it is full. If you have any questions about using your insulin pen, contact your diabetes care team. They can give you tips on how to make injecting your insulin easier. And know that with each injection, you are taking the steps you need for a healthy pregnancy. Now I seem like a pro at it. It's really not too difficult.

It was more so the fear of the unknown for me. When you have gestational diabetes, your diabetes care team may prescribe insulin to help you reach your blood glucose goals. Some women who inject insulin use an insulin pen. Keep in mind that there are several different pens to choose from, and each will have its own special instructions. Work with your diabetes care team to find the pen that works best for you, and learn how to use it to make sure you take your prescribed dose. Once I was educated, it became a little bit easier to deal with, so I was able to cope. At first glance, the insulin pen looks a lot like a writing pen, but it has a needle instead of a writing point, and an insulin cartridge rather than an ink cartridge. The following step-by-step preparation method can be used with most insulin pens. Gather your supplies. They include your pen, needle, alcohol swab, and a sharps container. Wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry them. Pull the outer cap of the pen off. Wipe the rubber seal at the top with alcohol. Get the needle and take the protective paper tab off. Screw the needle onto the pen tightly. You'll notice that it's still in its protective cap. Remove the outer needle cap. Take off the inner needle cap. It is important to prime your pen before each injection to help ensure your proper dose. To prime your pen, dial your pen to deliver two units of insulin by turning the dose knob until you see a two in the window. Point the pen straight up and push the injection button. You should see insulin come out of the needle tip. Your pen is now primed and you can set your dose. Turn the knob until your dose appears in the window. If you're using cloudy insulin, roll the pen between your hands and tip the pen end to end to mix at least 15 to 20 times. Now you're ready to inject your insulin. Insulin should be injected into fatty tissue. The recommended injection areas are the abdomen or belly, the backs of the arms, the tops or sides of the thigh, and the buttocks or rear. With some insulins, where you inject on your body can make a difference in how fast the insulin will go to work or its onset. Work with your diabetes care team to find the injection area that is best for you. Try to use the same area at the same time every day, but you should change the actual injection site each time you inject. This helps keep your skin and underlying tissues healthy. When injecting into your abdomen, make sure to stay two inches away from any scar tissue or your navel. Once you have selected an injection site, wipe the skin with alcohol and wait a few seconds for it to dry. Push the needle in at a 90 degree angle and push the injection button firmly and smoothly. Depending on the pen you use, you may need to wait five to ten seconds before pulling the pen straight out. Remove the needle and discard it properly in a sharps container, which you can get from your local pharmacy or other supplier of diabetes products. If you don't have a sharps container, a heavy plastic bottle with a tight-fitting lid clearly labeled that it contains medical waste will work too. In some areas, you are asked not to put filled sharps containers in your regular trash for collection. Your diabetes care team can tell you if your community has a specific place to take your sharps container when it is full. If you have any questions about using your insulin pen, contact your diabetes care team. They can give you tips on how to make injecting your insulin easier. And know that with each injection, you are taking the steps you need for a healthy pregnancy. Now I seem like a pro at it. It's really not too difficult. It's just part of the routine."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

It was more so the fear of the unknown for me. When you have gestational diabetes, your diabetes care team may prescribe insulin to help you reach your blood glucose goals. Some women who inject insulin use an insulin pen. Keep in mind that there are several different pens to choose from, and each will have its own special instructions. Work with your diabetes care team to find the pen that works best for you, and learn how to use it to make sure you take your prescribed dose. Once I was educated, it became a little bit easier to deal with, so I was able to cope. At first glance, the insulin pen looks a lot like a writing pen, but it has a needle instead of a writing point, and an insulin cartridge rather than an ink cartridge. The following step-by-step preparation method can be used with most insulin pens. Gather your supplies. They include your pen, needle, alcohol swab, and a sharps container. Wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry them. Pull the outer cap of the pen off. Wipe the rubber seal at the top with alcohol. Get the needle and take the protective paper tab off. Screw the needle onto the pen tightly. You'll notice that it's still in its protective cap. Remove the outer needle cap. Take off the inner needle cap. It is important to prime your pen before each injection to help ensure your proper dose. To prime your pen, dial your pen to deliver two units of insulin by turning the dose knob until you see a two in the window. Point the pen straight up and push the injection button. You should see insulin come out of the needle tip. Your pen is now primed and you can set your dose. Turn the knob until your dose appears in the window. If you're using cloudy insulin, roll the pen between your hands and tip the pen end to end to mix at least 15 to 20 times. Now you're ready to inject your insulin. Insulin should be injected into fatty tissue. The recommended injection areas are the abdomen or belly, the backs of the arms, the tops or sides of the thigh, and the buttocks or rear. With some insulins, where you inject on your body can make a difference in how fast the insulin will go to work or its onset. Work with your diabetes care team to find the injection area that is best for you. Try to use the same area at the same time every day, but you should change the actual injection site each time you inject. This helps keep your skin and underlying tissues healthy. When injecting into your abdomen, make sure to stay two inches away from any scar tissue or your navel. Once you have selected an injection site, wipe the skin with alcohol and wait a few seconds for it to dry. Push the needle in at a 90 degree angle and push the injection button firmly and smoothly. Depending on the pen you use, you may need to wait five to ten seconds before pulling the pen straight out. Remove the needle and discard it properly in a sharps container, which you can get from your local pharmacy or other supplier of diabetes products. If you don't have a sharps container, a heavy plastic bottle with a tight-fitting lid clearly labeled that it contains medical waste will work too. In some areas, you are asked not to put filled sharps containers in your regular trash for collection. Your diabetes care team can tell you if your community has a specific place to take your sharps container when it is full. If you have any questions about using your insulin pen, contact your diabetes care team. They can give you tips on how to make injecting your insulin easier. And know that with each injection, you are taking the steps you need for a healthy pregnancy. Now I seem like a pro at it. It's really not too difficult.

To begin, take off the pen cap. Check the appearance of your insulin. The insulin should be clear. Do not use if the insulin solution is cloudy or coloured. Each pen contains 300 units of insulin. You can set those from 1 to 60 units in the step of 1. Wipe the rubber seal with alcohol. Remove the protective seal from new needle. Line up the needle with the pen and keep it straight as you attach. If the needle is not kept straight, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage or break the needle. So it's important to keep it straight as you screw or push depending on the needle type. Before using the pen, it's very important to check the pen is working well and to remove all air bubbles. To do this, select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. Take off the outer needle cap to reuse and take off the inner needle cap and discard it. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rises up. Press the injection button and check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test 2 more times. If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. Make sure the dose window shows 0 after the safety test. To begin the injection process, turn the dosage selector in order to set the required dose. Do not push the injection button while turning as this will cause the insulin to come out. Hold the Dyspo pen within your palm and fingers as you see. Slowly insert the needle into the skin. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button. The number in the dose window will return to 0. Keep the injection button pressed for 10 seconds before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose is delivered. Make sure after injection the number in the dose window will return to 0. Place the outer cover and screw and remove the pin from the pen. Dispose the needle safely in a sharps container. Always put the pen cap back and store the pen until your next injection in a cool and dry place."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}
