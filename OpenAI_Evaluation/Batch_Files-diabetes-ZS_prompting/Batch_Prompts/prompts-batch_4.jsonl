Well, you know, and the sun. Good morning class. Good morning. My name is Nurse Nancy. I'm going to be your nurse facilitator for today. We're going to go ahead and talk about the importance of insulin injections. What are we injecting? Insulin. I'm Priscilla Cutting and this is my friend Loretta Jones. Hi Loretta. Hi. Well, welcome both of you to my class. First let me go ahead and assess your understanding of insulin. Do you both know what it's used for? Excuse me nurse, can you please speak up just a little bit? Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use. There's correct dosing. It makes it more accurate, things like that. Can I see one of those please? Sure, you can. So small. It is small. It really does look like a chicken. And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it. So after you've chosen a correct site, like I was saying, your abdomen or the back of your arm, you want to go ahead and make sure that you have a clean site. You would use one of these alcohol wipes like this. All right. One for you. One for you. So using the site that you've chosen, you want to go ahead and clean it. My little alcohol swab. You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day. It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro. I don't know about this one right here. Hey. I'm okay. Okay."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day. It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro. I don't know about this one right here. Hey. I'm okay. Okay."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Well, you know, and the sun. Good morning class. Good morning. My name is Nurse Nancy. I'm going to be your nurse facilitator for today. We're going to go ahead and talk about the importance of insulin injections. What are we injecting? Insulin. I'm Priscilla Cutting and this is my friend Loretta Jones. Hi Loretta. Hi. Well, welcome both of you to my class. First let me go ahead and assess your understanding of insulin. Do you both know what it's used for? Excuse me nurse, can you please speak up just a little bit? Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use. There's correct dosing. It makes it more accurate, things like that. Can I see one of those please? Sure, you can. So small. It is small. It really does look like a chicken. And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it.

Before we start, we need to assess our patients or their caregivers on the pain knowledge related to self-administered insulin pain. The teaching today will focus on the patient or the caregiver being first time introduced to self-administered insulin pain. Firstly, you have to provide basic information regarding the insulin pain itself. For example, the name of the insulin, what is the color code, the dosage and frequency, there's how many units and how many times per day and when they're going to inject this insulin. Followed by, introduce the equipment that's needed for the procedure. There's three, insulin pain, needle and alcohol swabs. Introduce all the parts of insulin pain and needle to the patient or caregiver if can. If the patient is using this type of insulin pain, they need to learn how to insert the pain pill into the cartridge holder. Firstly, you have to pull off the pain cap and unscrew the cartridge holder. If the rock is sticking out, push it all the way back. Insert the insulin into the cartridge holder, remember color code and first. And screw the cartridge holder back together and twist it until you can feel or hear a click sound. If the insulin is cloudy type, the patient have to always mix evenly before use. There's two ways to do about it. First, you can gently roll the pain between your palm for 10 times or you move the pain up and down for 10 times. After this, we need to assemble the needle on the insulin pad. First, clean the rubber shield with alcohol swabs. Remove the protective tab from the disposable needle and attach to the insulin pad. Remember, the needle is single use. Now, the pen is ready to be used. Before injecting to the patient, the patient need to prime the needle and make sure there is no air injected into the body. First, remove the both outer and inner needle caps. Dispose the inner cap but keep the outer cap. How to prime the needle? Turn the dosage button to 2 limits. Hold the insulin pen with the needle pointing upwards and press it until it returns to 0. A drop of insulin should be appeared at the tip of the needle. Now, you are ready to be injected into the body. If the insulin dose didn't appear, please repeat the steps. When the insulin pen is ready, turn the dose selected to the number that is needed as instructed by the doctor. Now, where to inject? For cells administered with insulin, the patient are advised to use abdomen and thigh. Abdomen is generally recommended. The area can be injected on the abdomen is 1 inch away from the umbilical cord. And remember to tell the patient to rotate the spot to avoid complications. After the area has been identified, the patient is advised to use a wet cloth to clean the area. Then, insert the needle at 90 degrees and press the button all the way until it is 0. And remain the needle in the skin and count 1 to 10 to ensure the full dose is been injected. Then, pull out the needle. After injection, lead the needle tips into the outer needle caps and unscrew the needle and dispose into a puncture-proof container. Now it's come to end of the session. If you have time, you are advised to read out further information about the insulin pen. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Before we start, we need to assess our patients or their caregivers on the pain knowledge related to self-administered insulin pain. The teaching today will focus on the patient or the caregiver being first time introduced to self-administered insulin pain. Firstly, you have to provide basic information regarding the insulin pain itself. For example, the name of the insulin, what is the color code, the dosage and frequency, there's how many units and how many times per day and when they're going to inject this insulin. Followed by, introduce the equipment that's needed for the procedure. There's three, insulin pain, needle and alcohol swabs. Introduce all the parts of insulin pain and needle to the patient or caregiver if can. If the patient is using this type of insulin pain, they need to learn how to insert the pain pill into the cartridge holder. Firstly, you have to pull off the pain cap and unscrew the cartridge holder. If the rock is sticking out, push it all the way back. Insert the insulin into the cartridge holder, remember color code and first. And screw the cartridge holder back together and twist it until you can feel or hear a click sound. If the insulin is cloudy type, the patient have to always mix evenly before use. There's two ways to do about it. First, you can gently roll the pain between your palm for 10 times or you move the pain up and down for 10 times. After this, we need to assemble the needle on the insulin pad. First, clean the rubber shield with alcohol swabs. Remove the protective tab from the disposable needle and attach to the insulin pad. Remember, the needle is single use. Now, the pen is ready to be used. Before injecting to the patient, the patient need to prime the needle and make sure there is no air injected into the body. First, remove the both outer and inner needle caps. Dispose the inner cap but keep the outer cap. How to prime the needle? Turn the dosage button to 2 limits. Hold the insulin pen with the needle pointing upwards and press it until it returns to 0. A drop of insulin should be appeared at the tip of the needle. Now, you are ready to be injected into the body. If the insulin dose didn't appear, please repeat the steps. When the insulin pen is ready, turn the dose selected to the number that is needed as instructed by the doctor. Now, where to inject? For cells administered with insulin, the patient are advised to use abdomen and thigh. Abdomen is generally recommended. The area can be injected on the abdomen is 1 inch away from the umbilical cord. And remember to tell the patient to rotate the spot to avoid complications. After the area has been identified, the patient is advised to use a wet cloth to clean the area. Then, insert the needle at 90 degrees and press the button all the way until it is 0. And remain the needle in the skin and count 1 to 10 to ensure the full dose is been injected. Then, pull out the needle. After injection, lead the needle tips into the outer needle caps and unscrew the needle and dispose into a puncture-proof container. Now it's come to end of the session.

Before we start, we need to assess our patients or their caregivers on the pain knowledge related to self-administered insulin pain. The teaching today will focus on the patient or the caregiver being first time introduced to self-administered insulin pain. Firstly, you have to provide basic information regarding the insulin pain itself. For example, the name of the insulin, what is the color code, the dosage and frequency, there's how many units and how many times per day and when they're going to inject this insulin. Followed by, introduce the equipment that's needed for the procedure. There's three, insulin pain, needle and alcohol swabs. Introduce all the parts of insulin pain and needle to the patient or caregiver if can. If the patient is using this type of insulin pain, they need to learn how to insert the pain pill into the cartridge holder. Firstly, you have to pull off the pain cap and unscrew the cartridge holder. If the rock is sticking out, push it all the way back. Insert the insulin into the cartridge holder, remember color code and first. And screw the cartridge holder back together and twist it until you can feel or hear a click sound. If the insulin is cloudy type, the patient have to always mix evenly before use. There's two ways to do about it. First, you can gently roll the pain between your palm for 10 times or you move the pain up and down for 10 times. After this, we need to assemble the needle on the insulin pad. First, clean the rubber shield with alcohol swabs. Remove the protective tab from the disposable needle and attach to the insulin pad. Remember, the needle is single use. Now, the pen is ready to be used. Before injecting to the patient, the patient need to prime the needle and make sure there is no air injected into the body. First, remove the both outer and inner needle caps. Dispose the inner cap but keep the outer cap. How to prime the needle? Turn the dosage button to 2 limits. Hold the insulin pen with the needle pointing upwards and press it until it returns to 0. A drop of insulin should be appeared at the tip of the needle. Now, you are ready to be injected into the body. If the insulin dose didn't appear, please repeat the steps. When the insulin pen is ready, turn the dose selected to the number that is needed as instructed by the doctor. Now, where to inject? For cells administered with insulin, the patient are advised to use abdomen and thigh. Abdomen is generally recommended.

I will be injecting semaglutide but this works with other things like peptides or any subcutaneous injection, insulin for example. But we're going to do semaglutide today and I'm going to show you how to do it with my clothes over me first and then we're actually going to go ahead and do it. So step one, you want to wash your hands and after you've done that, then you identify the best spot. For us, we're going to do the abdomen and what you do is you want to pinch the fat and doing this will bring all the fat close to the surface so that you ensure that you actually get it into the right spot. So as you pinch, you're going to clean with alcohol and then I like to fan it so that it dries the alcohol, otherwise you'll taste it as you inject. After that, you're going to inject at a 90-degree angle, so straight in and then after that you're going to deploy the medicine and then you pull it out and then you're done. Subcutaneous needles are very small, so this one is a 31-gauge and it's about the width of my fingernail, so it's very, very small. So if we're ready, we'll begin. So you pull your shirt off, obviously, and you're going to clean with alcohol, fan it, and then you go ahead and you add a 90-degree angle, it's going to go straight in and then you're going to push it in. You really will not even feel this because the needle is so thin. Then you let go and you are all set. Once again, my name is Oscar. I'm from Smooth Aesthetics.

For us, we're going to do the abdomen and what you do is you want to pinch the fat and doing this will bring all the fat close to the surface so that you ensure that you actually get it into the right spot. So as you pinch, you're going to clean with alcohol and then I like to fan it so that it dries the alcohol, otherwise you'll taste it as you inject. After that, you're going to inject at a 90-degree angle, so straight in and then after that you're going to deploy the medicine and then you pull it out and then you're done. Subcutaneous needles are very small, so this one is a 31-gauge and it's about the width of my fingernail, so it's very, very small. So if we're ready, we'll begin. So you pull your shirt off, obviously, and you're going to clean with alcohol, fan it, and then you go ahead and you add a 90-degree angle, it's going to go straight in and then you're going to push it in. You really will not even feel this because the needle is so thin. Then you let go and you are all set. Once again, my name is Oscar. I'm from Smooth Aesthetics.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hello, I'm Joshua Freitas. I'm going to be instructing a group of individuals about insulin administration. Now, this targeted audience is going to be very wide because anybody can be diagnosed as a diabetic and need to inject insulin due to their blood sugar being too high. So we're talking about insulin administration. This is for my nursing, teaching, and education class here. And like I said, I'm Joshua Freitas. Moving on here. What you want to look for when you're administering insulin or diabetic are signs of hypoglycemia. Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst. Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst. Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hello, I'm Joshua Freitas. I'm going to be instructing a group of individuals about insulin administration. Now, this targeted audience is going to be very wide because anybody can be diagnosed as a diabetic and need to inject insulin due to their blood sugar being too high. So we're talking about insulin administration. This is for my nursing, teaching, and education class here. And like I said, I'm Joshua Freitas. Moving on here. What you want to look for when you're administering insulin or diabetic are signs of hypoglycemia. Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst. Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center.

So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Now, this targeted audience is going to be very wide because anybody can be diagnosed as a diabetic and need to inject insulin due to their blood sugar being too high. So we're talking about insulin administration. This is for my nursing, teaching, and education class here. And like I said, I'm Joshua Freitas. Moving on here. What you want to look for when you're administering insulin or diabetic are signs of hypoglycemia. Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst. Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles.
