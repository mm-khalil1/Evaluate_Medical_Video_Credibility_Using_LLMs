This video will show you how to, one, use the different types of insulin pens, two, choose a good injection site, three, prepare for an injection and choose the right pen needle, and four, do the injection. There are several different types of insulin pens. Some insulin pens are disposable, with the insulin already in the pen. There is a plunger in the pen. Once it is at the end of the pen, you will need to use a new pen. Once the pen is empty, you can throw the whole pen in your recycle bin. Nondisposable insulin pens. Some insulin pens are nondisposable. They have a reusable pen which holds an insulin cartridge that is inserted into the pen. To open and replace the insulin cartridge, some of the nondisposable pens twist, with the two parts of the pen moving in opposite directions. Other pens unscrew. The insulin cartridge is put into the pen with the smaller end going in first. Nondisposable pens also have a plunger. Once the plunger is at the end of the insulin cartridge, you must replace the cartridge in the pen. Caring for your insulin pen and cartridge. Once you start using a disposable insulin pen or a pen with the insulin cartridge, keep them at room temperature. Insulin is only good for 28 days at room temperature. If you have not used all the insulin at the end of the 28 days, throw the remainder away and use a new pen or cartridge. Insulin pens or cartridges that you are not using should be kept in the refrigerator until you need them or until they expire. Check the box they come in for the expiry date. All insulin pen or cartridges hold a minimum of 300 units of insulin, allowing for multiple doses. The pen dials up units of insulin. The way to dial up the dose is by twisting the knob at the end of the pen. For the Novo nondisposable pens, you need to pull out the end before dialing. Choosing a good injection site. For adults, the abdomen is the best place to do the injection because the insulin is absorbed the same each time. Other possible sites are the thighs and buttocks. The arm is not recommended because it is very easy to inject in the muscle. To inject in the abdomen, do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of your belly button. There are a lot of blood vessels in this area. Do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of any bones like your hip or ribs. Do not inject into scar tissue from injuries or surgeries. Do not inject where there are bumps or lumps from lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy is damaged tissue that happens when insulin has been injected into the same area many times. Scar tissue occurs under the skin with decreased blood flow to the area. Decreased blood flow means that if you inject in this area, the insulin will not be absorbed and will not work as good as it should. Avoid these areas for at least 3 months. To prevent lipohypertrophy, do not inject in the same area. Keep moving your injection sites over by one finger width. Keep rotating to different areas. If you move to a new injection area, be careful of low blood sugars as your insulin may now absorb faster and work better. Preparing for Injection To prepare for an injection, you will need your insulin pen and a pen needle. Choose the right needle. The pen needle should be 4 to 6 mm needle. You will find the size of the needle on the tear off tab on the pen needle. Use a new needle each time you inject. Next wash your hands. Before preparing for or doing the injection to reduce your chance of getting an infection, pull the cap off the pen and check to make sure there is enough insulin. Check the insulin in the pen. The insulin in the pen or cartridge may be cloudy or clear. If it is a cloudy insulin, there are two types of insulin in the pen. The insulin must be mixed so that you get the right amount of insulin. To mix the insulin, roll the pen between your palms 10 times, then tip the pen 10 times. This should be done before every injection. Pull the tab off the pen needle and attach it to the pen by twisting the needle clockwise until it is tight. Remove the two caps from the needle. Dial up 2 units. Push the bottom of the pen to release the air from the needle. Look for a drop of the insulin on the end of the needle. If there is no insulin, dial up another 2 units and push the bottom again. Repeat these steps until you see insulin at the end of the needle. Dial up the dose of insulin you will inject. Doing the injection. First put the needle in your skin straight in, not at an angle. If you are very thin, you might need to pinch your skin and lift it up to prevent the injection from going into the muscle. Inject the insulin by pushing the button at the bottom of the pen all the way in. Check to make sure the dial goes to zero. Count to 10. While leaving the needle in place so that you will get all of the insulin, you will know if you didn't leave the needle in long enough if your skin is wet or you smell insulin. Remove the needle from your skin. Recap the needle using the larger outer cap. Turn it to the left to remove the needle. Throw the needle in a sharps container or glass container with a lid. Never put the needle into your regular garbage. Do not store the pen with the needle attached as air can be pulled into the pen if the room temperature changes."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

This video will show you how to, one, use the different types of insulin pens, two, choose a good injection site, three, prepare for an injection and choose the right pen needle, and four, do the injection. There are several different types of insulin pens. Some insulin pens are disposable, with the insulin already in the pen. There is a plunger in the pen. Once it is at the end of the pen, you will need to use a new pen. Once the pen is empty, you can throw the whole pen in your recycle bin. Nondisposable insulin pens. Some insulin pens are nondisposable. They have a reusable pen which holds an insulin cartridge that is inserted into the pen. To open and replace the insulin cartridge, some of the nondisposable pens twist, with the two parts of the pen moving in opposite directions. Other pens unscrew. The insulin cartridge is put into the pen with the smaller end going in first. Nondisposable pens also have a plunger. Once the plunger is at the end of the insulin cartridge, you must replace the cartridge in the pen. Caring for your insulin pen and cartridge. Once you start using a disposable insulin pen or a pen with the insulin cartridge, keep them at room temperature. Insulin is only good for 28 days at room temperature. If you have not used all the insulin at the end of the 28 days, throw the remainder away and use a new pen or cartridge. Insulin pens or cartridges that you are not using should be kept in the refrigerator until you need them or until they expire. Check the box they come in for the expiry date. All insulin pen or cartridges hold a minimum of 300 units of insulin, allowing for multiple doses. The pen dials up units of insulin. The way to dial up the dose is by twisting the knob at the end of the pen. For the Novo nondisposable pens, you need to pull out the end before dialing. Choosing a good injection site. For adults, the abdomen is the best place to do the injection because the insulin is absorbed the same each time. Other possible sites are the thighs and buttocks. The arm is not recommended because it is very easy to inject in the muscle. To inject in the abdomen, do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of your belly button. There are a lot of blood vessels in this area. Do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of any bones like your hip or ribs. Do not inject into scar tissue from injuries or surgeries. Do not inject where there are bumps or lumps from lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy is damaged tissue that happens when insulin has been injected into the same area many times. Scar tissue occurs under the skin with decreased blood flow to the area. Decreased blood flow means that if you inject in this area, the insulin will not be absorbed and will not work as good as it should. Avoid these areas for at least 3 months. To prevent lipohypertrophy, do not inject in the same area. Keep moving your injection sites over by one finger width. Keep rotating to different areas. If you move to a new injection area, be careful of low blood sugars as your insulin may now absorb faster and work better. Preparing for Injection To prepare for an injection, you will need your insulin pen and a pen needle. Choose the right needle. The pen needle should be 4 to 6 mm needle. You will find the size of the needle on the tear off tab on the pen needle. Use a new needle each time you inject. Next wash your hands. Before preparing for or doing the injection to reduce your chance of getting an infection, pull the cap off the pen and check to make sure there is enough insulin. Check the insulin in the pen. The insulin in the pen or cartridge may be cloudy or clear. If it is a cloudy insulin, there are two types of insulin in the pen. The insulin must be mixed so that you get the right amount of insulin. To mix the insulin, roll the pen between your palms 10 times, then tip the pen 10 times. This should be done before every injection. Pull the tab off the pen needle and attach it to the pen by twisting the needle clockwise until it is tight. Remove the two caps from the needle. Dial up 2 units. Push the bottom of the pen to release the air from the needle. Look for a drop of the insulin on the end of the needle. If there is no insulin, dial up another 2 units and push the bottom again. Repeat these steps until you see insulin at the end of the needle. Dial up the dose of insulin you will inject. Doing the injection. First put the needle in your skin straight in, not at an angle. If you are very thin, you might need to pinch your skin and lift it up to prevent the injection from going into the muscle. Inject the insulin by pushing the button at the bottom of the pen all the way in. Check to make sure the dial goes to zero. Count to 10.

This should be done before every injection. Pull the tab off the pen needle and attach it to the pen by twisting the needle clockwise until it is tight. Remove the two caps from the needle. Dial up 2 units. Push the bottom of the pen to release the air from the needle. Look for a drop of the insulin on the end of the needle. If there is no insulin, dial up another 2 units and push the bottom again. Repeat these steps until you see insulin at the end of the needle. Dial up the dose of insulin you will inject. Doing the injection. First put the needle in your skin straight in, not at an angle. If you are very thin, you might need to pinch your skin and lift it up to prevent the injection from going into the muscle. Inject the insulin by pushing the button at the bottom of the pen all the way in. Check to make sure the dial goes to zero. Count to 10. While leaving the needle in place so that you will get all of the insulin, you will know if you didn't leave the needle in long enough if your skin is wet or you smell insulin. Remove the needle from your skin. Recap the needle using the larger outer cap. Turn it to the left to remove the needle. Throw the needle in a sharps container or glass container with a lid. Never put the needle into your regular garbage. Do not store the pen with the needle attached as air can be pulled into the pen if the room temperature changes."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

This video will show you how to, one, use the different types of insulin pens, two, choose a good injection site, three, prepare for an injection and choose the right pen needle, and four, do the injection. There are several different types of insulin pens. Some insulin pens are disposable, with the insulin already in the pen. There is a plunger in the pen. Once it is at the end of the pen, you will need to use a new pen. Once the pen is empty, you can throw the whole pen in your recycle bin. Nondisposable insulin pens. Some insulin pens are nondisposable. They have a reusable pen which holds an insulin cartridge that is inserted into the pen. To open and replace the insulin cartridge, some of the nondisposable pens twist, with the two parts of the pen moving in opposite directions. Other pens unscrew. The insulin cartridge is put into the pen with the smaller end going in first. Nondisposable pens also have a plunger. Once the plunger is at the end of the insulin cartridge, you must replace the cartridge in the pen. Caring for your insulin pen and cartridge. Once you start using a disposable insulin pen or a pen with the insulin cartridge, keep them at room temperature. Insulin is only good for 28 days at room temperature. If you have not used all the insulin at the end of the 28 days, throw the remainder away and use a new pen or cartridge. Insulin pens or cartridges that you are not using should be kept in the refrigerator until you need them or until they expire. Check the box they come in for the expiry date. All insulin pen or cartridges hold a minimum of 300 units of insulin, allowing for multiple doses. The pen dials up units of insulin. The way to dial up the dose is by twisting the knob at the end of the pen. For the Novo nondisposable pens, you need to pull out the end before dialing. Choosing a good injection site. For adults, the abdomen is the best place to do the injection because the insulin is absorbed the same each time. Other possible sites are the thighs and buttocks. The arm is not recommended because it is very easy to inject in the muscle. To inject in the abdomen, do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of your belly button. There are a lot of blood vessels in this area. Do not inject within 2 cm or 1 inch of any bones like your hip or ribs. Do not inject into scar tissue from injuries or surgeries. Do not inject where there are bumps or lumps from lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy is damaged tissue that happens when insulin has been injected into the same area many times. Scar tissue occurs under the skin with decreased blood flow to the area. Decreased blood flow means that if you inject in this area, the insulin will not be absorbed and will not work as good as it should. Avoid these areas for at least 3 months. To prevent lipohypertrophy, do not inject in the same area. Keep moving your injection sites over by one finger width. Keep rotating to different areas. If you move to a new injection area, be careful of low blood sugars as your insulin may now absorb faster and work better. Preparing for Injection To prepare for an injection, you will need your insulin pen and a pen needle. Choose the right needle. The pen needle should be 4 to 6 mm needle. You will find the size of the needle on the tear off tab on the pen needle. Use a new needle each time you inject. Next wash your hands. Before preparing for or doing the injection to reduce your chance of getting an infection, pull the cap off the pen and check to make sure there is enough insulin. Check the insulin in the pen. The insulin in the pen or cartridge may be cloudy or clear. If it is a cloudy insulin, there are two types of insulin in the pen.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi everybody, Nurse Scott here. How are you? Today's video is less of a vlog, like what's going on with me, and more of a how-to. The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery. Injecting yourself on a regular basis is pretty daunting, and it was to me too when I started needing to do that. So there are a couple of tricks to do this. I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner. So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi everybody, Nurse Scott here. How are you? Today's video is less of a vlog, like what's going on with me, and more of a how-to. The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery. Injecting yourself on a regular basis is pretty daunting, and it was to me too when I started needing to do that. So there are a couple of tricks to do this. I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner.

Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery. Injecting yourself on a regular basis is pretty daunting, and it was to me too when I started needing to do that. So there are a couple of tricks to do this. I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner. So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets.

It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi everybody, Nurse Scott here. How are you? Today's video is less of a vlog, like what's going on with me, and more of a how-to. The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery. Injecting yourself on a regular basis is pretty daunting, and it was to me too when I started needing to do that. So there are a couple of tricks to do this. I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner. So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein. We're going in a muscle anyway. So this is going to help when we inject it into the skin and put it in. It's going to go fluid first and then some air so that inside the muscle there will be a little bubble of medication with some air at the top. It helps to lock that in place so that the medication doesn't leak out of the hole that the needle makes. You can see here the needle is much, much thinner. So when we're talking about giving a painless injection, one of the tricks is to use a very small needle. In this case, I believe it's a 23 gauge. And it's also all in the technique, which I will show you next. First we need to find where we're going to give the injection. In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

The background on this is that I had a regular YouTube channel with just my, you know, just fun videos. My dog's doing stuff whenever I was playing saxophone out someplace. And I happened to make one video on how to give yourself an injection without pain. A painless self-injection. I myself have to inject myself every two weeks with some testosterone. And it's in the muscle, and you know, you hear people talk about, I can never be diabetic, I can never give myself shots. Well, those shots are tiny, tiny, tiny compared to what you need to do, the size of the needle you need to use for a muscle injection. But it can still be done without pain. And it turns out that that video, which was so amateurish and had goofy music behind it, I'll put a link, it turns out this little video was my most popular by far. You know, my stupid dog videos get like 75 views or something like that, and that takes years. This got a million and a half views, so I realized that's what the universe wants from me on YouTube, is some practical information. And what I think, I've kind of looked at the comments and where it's been shared and copied in a couple of cases. I think there are a lot of people who are trans and have to take hormones as part of their transition process. And that, for a lot of them, is a really difficult part of the transition, not only changing your name on your driver's license, not only explaining things to your boss, not only, you know, coming out, not only dealing with surgery and even being able to afford surgery.

I'm going to demonstrate for you now, and then we'll talk about it a little bit afterwards. So here's everything that you're going to need. The medication that you're going to inject, in this case testosterone, an alcohol swab, a syringe of the right size, I'm going to be administering one mil, so that's a third of a 3cc syringe. You can use a smaller syringe where it only holds one cc. And then this is a very thick, viscous medication, so there's no way I'm going to draw it up in a tiny needle like this. I'm going to need something that's bigger or else it'll take forever. So the first step is to clean off the top of the vial with a little alcohol. Take out the syringe and remove that needle and put on the bigger needle. Okay. Then we want to stab the vial. Turn it over. There's usually enough air in here. You don't have to inject air, but you can inject a little air in here to displace the fluid. And then we want to draw out one cc. So we draw a little bit more than that. Tap. Tap. Get the bubbles out. I've got more bubbles. And find one mil right there. And we can pull this out. Now, this is an old technique, but it still works. You pull back and maybe even that much air. Put that much air in the syringe. And the reason we do this is to lock the medication in place. It is not dangerous. There's an old kind of myth that injecting air into a vein, if you were giving something IV, if you inject it into a vein, that that air would go to your heart and give you a heart attack. Small amounts of air, even in a vein, don't cause damage. They just get dissolved into the blood. I guess a large amount of air might do it. In this case, we're not going in a vein.

In the thigh, we want to put a hand here and a hand here and find the middle third of the thigh. And then we want to give it on the outer third, or at least outer half, into the muscle. We can feel parts of the leg are very tenderness. This is very fleshy. That's a muscle. So first, use our alcohol swab to clean that area. Let it dry. It's the drying of the alcohol that actually kills the bacteria. I'm going to make sure our air is where it's supposed to be. Maybe give a little tap on our syringe. All right. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your leg. So here's the trick. Two tricks. Well, three tricks. One, stretch that skin. You can even see it blanch a little bit here. Stretch the skin. That also is going to help it not leak out after you're done. Second, your motion needs to be a quick jab at 90 degrees. Not this kind of thing. All right? But like a dart. Boom. You go so fast your little nerves won't know what to think. And the other trick is to cough while you do it. When you cough, think about it. Your whole body kind of... And your brain is receiving these signals from all over the body that it's moving. And when there's that, plus this pinch, if there is even much of a pinch, it really has a heart. Your brain is going to be able to move. So here we go. There's my spot. It's still clean. I'm going to stretch. I'm going to jab and cough. And I swear to God I didn't feel that. Pull back to see if there's any blood coming back and there's not. We're going to push the medication in. This takes some pressure because it's thick. And there's the air. And then we're going to just pull it straight out of the air. I kind of didn't go 90 degrees, did I? And then we want to rub this. See if there's any bleeding. Because I stretched it, when I made a hole with the needle and then let go, the hole closed on itself. So only one little spot of bleeding. Didn't hurt a bit. Clean that up. Put the needle in a sharps container. Keep it safe. And with intramuscular injections, most of the time, you can rub them. This helps get rid of any soreness you might feel. And it also helps the medication kind of be absorbed into that muscle. And that is that. So that's that. It was pretty easy. Of course, the more you do it, the easier it gets. If you can overcome that pain, you can do it. If you can overcome that fear at the very beginning, I mean, it's only natural we don't want to hurt ourselves. If we were supposed to hit ourselves on the thumb with a hammer, I think all of us would be kind of hesitant to do that. And this seems like the same kind of thing as putting a needle in ourselves. But it doesn't have to be. Remember those tips. One, stretch the skin. You've got nerve endings in your skin. And when you stretch it, they stretch with it. And you're going to hit fewer of them. It also kind of numbs them when they're stretched like that. And also, when you make a hole in something that's stretched, when it comes back together when you're done, that hole closes up. You're going to have much less bleeding. The second tip, jab like a dart, quickly. I've been giving IM injections, intramuscular injections, for years and years and years. And this is how I've always done it. And I cannot tell you the number of times people have said, wow, really? That didn't hurt. I'm like, you know, I can do it again if you feel like you're being short-changed. And they laugh and they go, no, no, no, no, no. Jab it in. That's number two. Number three, cough. I don't know where I found this little tip, but I did. And it's great when you cough, like I said, just to review. Your body vibrates. And your brain is trying to process all these signals. And when it suddenly gets signals from the whole body, hey, there's movement in the whole body, plus a signal going ouch, there's a pain in my thigh from a needle. It has to kind of make sense of all those on the spot. And a lot of times, especially when you jab and when you stretch, that signal kind of gets lost in the nose. That's my best explanation for why that works. So if you need to inject yourself intramuscularly, this is how you do that. Some of the same kind of things can be said for subcutaneous injections like insulin and some other things. But this, just so you know, is specifically for intramuscular injections. So please, if you're trans, I hope this helps you out. I hope this helps you do what you need to do to live your best life. If you are on hormone replacement therapy as a man like I am, I hope this helps you. Please share it with anyone you think will find it useful. Make sure to like this video. That helps me.

It's important to always wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds prior to giving an insulin injection. Insulin helps take the glucose in your blood and move it into your cells to provide energy. All patients with type 1 diabetes and many patients with type 2 diabetes need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Many patients need two different types of insulin. Basil or long-acting insulin is insulin given once or twice daily to control your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Basil insulin should be taken every day regardless of eating. Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. We'll start with how to give an injection with an insulin pen. First, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. Take the cap off your pen and wipe it clean with the second alcohol wipe. Take a new pen needle and peel off the paper backing. Twist the pen needle on your pen. Attach the pen needle immediately before you give an injection and do not store the insulin pen with a pen needle attached. The pen needle has two caps, an outer cap and an inner cap. Take off the clear outer cap and save it. Carefully take off the inner cap exposing the needle. Before every injection, you should prime the needle or give a test shot of insulin. Turn the pen dial to two units. Turn the pen so that the pen needle is pointed straight up. Press the button and you will see a spray or drops of insulin at the end of the pen needle. Priming the pen needle gets all the air out of the needle and ensures that the pen is working and dose is accurate. Now dial the pen to the dose prescribed by your doctor. You are ready to give the injection. If you are using a nano pen needle, there is no reason to pinch your skin. For all other length pen needles, gently pinch your skin where you are going to inject. Inject at a 90 degree angle into your skin. Push the pen button and watch the dial turn down to zero. Count to ten before removing the needle. Put the clear outer cap back on the pen needle and twist off to remove the needle. Never store your pen with a used needle attached. Put the cap back on the pen to keep it clean. All sharps should be disposed in a sharps container. You can make your own sharps container by using a hard plastic bottle like a laundry detergent or milk jug. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control or DHEC provides free stickers to place on your sharps bottle. When your sharps container is three-quarters full, it can be thrown away into the normal trash. DHEC will mail these stickers to your home for free or you can print them from their website."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. We'll start with how to give an injection with an insulin pen. First, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. Take the cap off your pen and wipe it clean with the second alcohol wipe. Take a new pen needle and peel off the paper backing. Twist the pen needle on your pen. Attach the pen needle immediately before you give an injection and do not store the insulin pen with a pen needle attached. The pen needle has two caps, an outer cap and an inner cap. Take off the clear outer cap and save it. Carefully take off the inner cap exposing the needle. Before every injection, you should prime the needle or give a test shot of insulin. Turn the pen dial to two units. Turn the pen so that the pen needle is pointed straight up. Press the button and you will see a spray or drops of insulin at the end of the pen needle. Priming the pen needle gets all the air out of the needle and ensures that the pen is working and dose is accurate. Now dial the pen to the dose prescribed by your doctor. You are ready to give the injection. If you are using a nano pen needle, there is no reason to pinch your skin. For all other length pen needles, gently pinch your skin where you are going to inject. Inject at a 90 degree angle into your skin. Push the pen button and watch the dial turn down to zero. Count to ten before removing the needle. Put the clear outer cap back on the pen needle and twist off to remove the needle. Never store your pen with a used needle attached. Put the cap back on the pen to keep it clean. All sharps should be disposed in a sharps container. You can make your own sharps container by using a hard plastic bottle like a laundry detergent or milk jug. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control or DHEC provides free stickers to place on your sharps bottle. When your sharps container is three-quarters full, it can be thrown away into the normal trash. DHEC will mail these stickers to your home for free or you can print them from their website."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

It's important to always wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds prior to giving an insulin injection. Insulin helps take the glucose in your blood and move it into your cells to provide energy. All patients with type 1 diabetes and many patients with type 2 diabetes need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Many patients need two different types of insulin. Basil or long-acting insulin is insulin given once or twice daily to control your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Basil insulin should be taken every day regardless of eating. Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. If you use an insulin vial, always clean the top of the vial with a new alcohol swab before each injection. Use a new syringe for each injection. Each syringe has two caps, an orange cap that protects the needle and a white cap to cover the syringe plunger. Both of these caps will be removed prior to using the syringe. To draw up your insulin dose, first draw air into the syringe equal to your dose of insulin. Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle. Push the air into the vial. Flip the vial over to withdraw insulin. Pull back on the plunger until you have the correct amount of insulin in your syringe. Be sure to measure at the top of the black plunger. If you have any air bubbles, push them back into the vial and pull out more insulin until your dose is correct. Air bubbles will not hurt you, but your dose will not be accurate. If using a syringe, hold the syringe like a dart and gently pinch your skin where you're going to inject. Inject at a 90-degree angle. Inject the insulin and count to 10 before removing the syringe. Throw the syringe directly into your sharps container. Never recap a syringe."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}
