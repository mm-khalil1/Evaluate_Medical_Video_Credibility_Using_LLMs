Dr. David has prescribed you a once daily insulin injection to help your glucose control improve. There are many different types of insulin and these are available in valves, cartridges and insulin pans. The insulin that is prescribed for you is a background insulin that comes in insulin pan device. The insulin pans are pre-filled with insulin and you can use it multiple times until the pan is empty. There are many different types of insulin pan devices each containing different types of insulin. These are coded with different colors and it is important for you to know the name of the insulin you are on, recognize the pan device and how much insulin you are supposed to give yourself. Now I'm going to show you how to use this insulin pan, demonstrate the injection technique followed by how best to care for and store the pan. Thank you for your explanation. I'm ready to start. First wash your hands before handling the insulin pan. Each time you are giving an insulin dose, you will need to prepare two alcohol swabs. Insulin pan needle. Insulin pan needles come in different lengths. In general, 4 to 6 mm needles should be sufficiently long. A hard container for the disposal of used needle. Step 1. Remove the pan cap. Clean the tip of the pan with an alcohol swab. Step 2. Remove the protective tab from the needle then attach the needle to the pan and screw tightly onto the pan. Remove the outer needle cap and put it aside. Remove and discard the inner cap. Pan devices should be primed according to the manufacturer instructions before each injection to remove any air bubbles and ensure that the pan and the needles are working properly. Some pans require 2 units and others require 3 units. Step 3. Prime the insulin pan to remove air bubbles and ensure that the needle is working properly. To do so, turn the dose selector to 2 units for this pan. Hold the pan with the needle pointing upwards and tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles will rise upwards towards the needle. Press the dosing button all the way till the dose selector turns to zero. Check and make sure you see a drop of insulin appearing at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the priming. Step 4. Check that the dose selector is set at zero after the safety check and turn to the required dose as ordered. Dr. David has prescribed 16 units. Turn the dose selector slowly until you see the number 16 lining out with the pointer. Let's try to do the injection now. Step 5. Clean the injection side with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry. Grip the pan firmly and insert the needle perpendicularly into the skin. Inject the insulin slowly. Lean people should consider using the Shouters needle 4mm and lifting a skin fold for injection. Press the dosing button all the way until the marking zero lines out with the pointer. Continue to press the dosing button and start counting slowly to 10. This is to ensure you have received the full dose of insulin. Redraw the needle before releasing the skin fold if applicable. Importantly, you should not inject true clothing. Step 6. Cover the needle with the big outer needle cap tightly and use it to unscrew the needle from the pan. Step 7. You will need a sharp container to discard the used needle. Now put the pan cap back. You can purchase sharp container from selected pharmacist. When the container is full, seal it before disposing of it. You must not discard used needle into regular rubbish beans. Insulin pan needles are only meant to be used just once to avoid the risk of infections. Besides, reusing needles will make them blunt and subsequent injection may hurt and cause bruising. You may inject over the abdomen within the following areas. Up to 1cm below the lowest rib, 1cm away from amyloid laterally towards the flanks and 1cm above the synthesis pubis. Injection sites should be rotated to avoid repeat tissue trauma. A good way for rotation will be to divide the injection sites into quadrants using one per week and moving quadrants to quadrants in a consistent direction. Injections should be rotated in such a way that there are space at least 1cm from each other. Rotating your injection sites will help prevent lumps and hardened tissue from forming. The new unopened insulin pans are to be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Insulin pan must not be frozen. Do remember to label each pan with a date when you have opened it. Aspired insulin must not be used. Thank you, Neswifen, for the detailed explanation and guidance. You're welcome."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Dr. David has prescribed you a once daily insulin injection to help your glucose control improve. There are many different types of insulin and these are available in valves, cartridges and insulin pans. The insulin that is prescribed for you is a background insulin that comes in insulin pan device. The insulin pans are pre-filled with insulin and you can use it multiple times until the pan is empty. There are many different types of insulin pan devices each containing different types of insulin. These are coded with different colors and it is important for you to know the name of the insulin you are on, recognize the pan device and how much insulin you are supposed to give yourself. Now I'm going to show you how to use this insulin pan, demonstrate the injection technique followed by how best to care for and store the pan. Thank you for your explanation. I'm ready to start. First wash your hands before handling the insulin pan. Each time you are giving an insulin dose, you will need to prepare two alcohol swabs. Insulin pan needle. Insulin pan needles come in different lengths. In general, 4 to 6 mm needles should be sufficiently long. A hard container for the disposal of used needle. Step 1. Remove the pan cap. Clean the tip of the pan with an alcohol swab. Step 2. Remove the protective tab from the needle then attach the needle to the pan and screw tightly onto the pan. Remove the outer needle cap and put it aside. Remove and discard the inner cap. Pan devices should be primed according to the manufacturer instructions before each injection to remove any air bubbles and ensure that the pan and the needles are working properly. Some pans require 2 units and others require 3 units. Step 3. Prime the insulin pan to remove air bubbles and ensure that the needle is working properly. To do so, turn the dose selector to 2 units for this pan. Hold the pan with the needle pointing upwards and tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles will rise upwards towards the needle. Press the dosing button all the way till the dose selector turns to zero. Check and make sure you see a drop of insulin appearing at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the priming. Step 4. Check that the dose selector is set at zero after the safety check and turn to the required dose as ordered. Dr. David has prescribed 16 units. Turn the dose selector slowly until you see the number 16 lining out with the pointer. Let's try to do the injection now. Step 5. Clean the injection side with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry. Grip the pan firmly and insert the needle perpendicularly into the skin. Inject the insulin slowly. Lean people should consider using the Shouters needle 4mm and lifting a skin fold for injection. Press the dosing button all the way until the marking zero lines out with the pointer. Continue to press the dosing button and start counting slowly to 10. This is to ensure you have received the full dose of insulin. Redraw the needle before releasing the skin fold if applicable. Importantly, you should not inject true clothing. Step 6. Cover the needle with the big outer needle cap tightly and use it to unscrew the needle from the pan. Step 7. You will need a sharp container to discard the used needle. Now put the pan cap back. You can purchase sharp container from selected pharmacist. When the container is full, seal it before disposing of it. You must not discard used needle into regular rubbish beans. Insulin pan needles are only meant to be used just once to avoid the risk of infections. Besides, reusing needles will make them blunt and subsequent injection may hurt and cause bruising. You may inject over the abdomen within the following areas. Up to 1cm below the lowest rib, 1cm away from amyloid laterally towards the flanks and 1cm above the synthesis pubis. Injection sites should be rotated to avoid repeat tissue trauma. A good way for rotation will be to divide the injection sites into quadrants using one per week and moving quadrants to quadrants in a consistent direction. Injections should be rotated in such a way that there are space at least 1cm from each other. Rotating your injection sites will help prevent lumps and hardened tissue from forming. The new unopened insulin pans are to be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Insulin pan must not be frozen. Do remember to label each pan with a date when you have opened it. Aspired insulin must not be used. Thank you, Neswifen, for the detailed explanation and guidance. You're welcome."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

To prepare insulin for administration, first check the healthcare provider's orders. Determine the patient's blood glucose level. And when his next meal will be. The usual interval between injecting rapid acting insulin and eating a meal should be no more than 5 to 15 minutes. Different kinds of insulin have different times of onset, peak effects, and durations of action. Rapid acting types such as insulin lispro, aspart, and glulacine begin to act in 15 to 30 minutes and produce peak effects in 1 to 3 hours. These effects last 3 to 6 and a half hours. Short acting types including regular insulin begin to act in 30 minutes to 1 hour and produce their most significant effects in 1 to 5 hours. These effects last 6 to 10 hours. Intermediate acting types of insulin such as isophane insulin suspension start to act in 1 to 2 hours and exert their maximum effect in 6 to 14 hours. They last 16 to 24 hours. Insulin detemir or levomir begins to act in 0.8 to 2 hours and is non-peaking. Its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Because of these and other differences, the various types of insulin are not interchangeable and cannot be substituted for one another without the prescriber's approval. Once you've obtained the prescribed medication, check the label against the Medication Administration Record or MAR. Look at the date on the vial to make sure the insulin has not expired. If the medication has been refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before administering it. Select the insulin for changes that may indicate a loss of potency such as clumping, frosting, precipitation or altered color or clarity. If you're using a correction scale to administer the insulin, obtain a current bedside blood glucose and note the amount to draw up based on the patient's blood glucose. Now select an injection site. In an upper arm, the anterior or lateral aspect of a thigh, the buttocks or the abdomen, but avoid the 2 inch radius around the umbilicus. When choosing a site, consider the expected absorption rate. Insulin is absorbed fastest from the abdomen followed by the arms, thighs and buttocks. Remember to rotate sites. The patient can choose one area, such as the abdomen, and systematically rotate sites within that region. When all those sites are used, you can move to another region, such as the thigh, or he can start the rotation pattern over again in the same region. Draw up the insulin as shown in the video skill preparing injections from a vial, or mix a combination of insulins as shown in the video skill, drawing up more than one type of insulin. Compare the vial and the filled syringe with the MAR. Have another nurse verify that you've drawn up the correct dosage. If you draw up insulin away from the patient's bedside, place a label on the syringe indicating the type and amount of insulin it contains. When teaching patients to use an insulin administration pen, demonstrate how to remove the cap, insert and secure the disposable needle, and then dial the prescribed number of units.

To prepare insulin for administration, first check the healthcare provider's orders. Determine the patient's blood glucose level. And when his next meal will be. The usual interval between injecting rapid acting insulin and eating a meal should be no more than 5 to 15 minutes. Different kinds of insulin have different times of onset, peak effects, and durations of action. Rapid acting types such as insulin lispro, aspart, and glulacine begin to act in 15 to 30 minutes and produce peak effects in 1 to 3 hours. These effects last 3 to 6 and a half hours. Short acting types including regular insulin begin to act in 30 minutes to 1 hour and produce their most significant effects in 1 to 5 hours. These effects last 6 to 10 hours. Intermediate acting types of insulin such as isophane insulin suspension start to act in 1 to 2 hours and exert their maximum effect in 6 to 14 hours. They last 16 to 24 hours. Insulin detemir or levomir begins to act in 0.8 to 2 hours and is non-peaking. Its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Because of these and other differences, the various types of insulin are not interchangeable and cannot be substituted for one another without the prescriber's approval. Once you've obtained the prescribed medication, check the label against the Medication Administration Record or MAR. Look at the date on the vial to make sure the insulin has not expired. If the medication has been refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before administering it. Select the insulin for changes that may indicate a loss of potency such as clumping, frosting, precipitation or altered color or clarity. If you're using a correction scale to administer the insulin, obtain a current bedside blood glucose and note the amount to draw up based on the patient's blood glucose. Now select an injection site. In an upper arm, the anterior or lateral aspect of a thigh, the buttocks or the abdomen, but avoid the 2 inch radius around the umbilicus. When choosing a site, consider the expected absorption rate. Insulin is absorbed fastest from the abdomen followed by the arms, thighs and buttocks. Remember to rotate sites. The patient can choose one area, such as the abdomen, and systematically rotate sites within that region. When all those sites are used, you can move to another region, such as the thigh, or he can start the rotation pattern over again in the same region. Draw up the insulin as shown in the video skill preparing injections from a vial, or mix a combination of insulins as shown in the video skill, drawing up more than one type of insulin.

Rapid acting types such as insulin lispro, aspart, and glulacine begin to act in 15 to 30 minutes and produce peak effects in 1 to 3 hours. These effects last 3 to 6 and a half hours. Short acting types including regular insulin begin to act in 30 minutes to 1 hour and produce their most significant effects in 1 to 5 hours. These effects last 6 to 10 hours. Intermediate acting types of insulin such as isophane insulin suspension start to act in 1 to 2 hours and exert their maximum effect in 6 to 14 hours. They last 16 to 24 hours. Insulin detemir or levomir begins to act in 0.8 to 2 hours and is non-peaking. Its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Because of these and other differences, the various types of insulin are not interchangeable and cannot be substituted for one another without the prescriber's approval. Once you've obtained the prescribed medication, check the label against the Medication Administration Record or MAR. Look at the date on the vial to make sure the insulin has not expired. If the medication has been refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before administering it. Select the insulin for changes that may indicate a loss of potency such as clumping, frosting, precipitation or altered color or clarity. If you're using a correction scale to administer the insulin, obtain a current bedside blood glucose and note the amount to draw up based on the patient's blood glucose. Now select an injection site. In an upper arm, the anterior or lateral aspect of a thigh, the buttocks or the abdomen, but avoid the 2 inch radius around the umbilicus. When choosing a site, consider the expected absorption rate. Insulin is absorbed fastest from the abdomen followed by the arms, thighs and buttocks. Remember to rotate sites. The patient can choose one area, such as the abdomen, and systematically rotate sites within that region. When all those sites are used, you can move to another region, such as the thigh, or he can start the rotation pattern over again in the same region. Draw up the insulin as shown in the video skill preparing injections from a vial, or mix a combination of insulins as shown in the video skill, drawing up more than one type of insulin. Compare the vial and the filled syringe with the MAR. Have another nurse verify that you've drawn up the correct dosage. If you draw up insulin away from the patient's bedside, place a label on the syringe indicating the type and amount of insulin it contains. When teaching patients to use an insulin administration pen, demonstrate how to remove the cap, insert and secure the disposable needle, and then dial the prescribed number of units. Have him demonstrate the insulin injection as shown in the video skill administering subcutaneous injections. Patients should demonstrate insulin self-administration whenever possible. Discard used supplies, clean up your work area, and perform hand hygiene."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Prior to that time, type 1 diabetes was really essentially a death sentence for those who were diagnosed with it. There are some very famous pictures of young children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and really became emaciated and looked like they were close to death. Then afterwards, after they had received insulin, looked like healthy young children that they should have been. So, the discovery of insulin changed type 1 diabetes from something that really couldn't be managed to something that became the experience, really not what we have today because it has evolved so much over time, but it allowed people to at least live day to day and eat and participate in activities. It really changed it from something that you are counting the days to a situation where you could live with it. The care and management of type 1 diabetes has evolved tremendously since the time that I was diagnosed. It was 1978 and I was four years old when I was diagnosed. Fall and spring tend to be those times where it really peaks and I had that same experience. It was just after Halloween and right before Thanksgiving. At that time, we had just a very limited amount or number of different types of insulin. When I was diagnosed, we were using pork insulin and we were testing sugar in the urine rather than in the bloodstream or now with continuous glucose monitoring, the subcutaneous space. So it was really very limited in terms of how we were able to manage it. I initially took two shots of two different types of insulin per day and I really felt like looking back, the approach was we are going to give a lot of insulin at one time and then you have to kind of keep up with it throughout the day by eating. Whereas today, we give insulin to try to match what we are going to eat. So it is a much more physiologic approach. Rather than feeding the insulin, we are using the insulin to cover what we choose to eat. In terms of the monitoring of diabetes, I think that has been a tremendous not only improvement but just an evolution of the way we did it. Initially when I was diagnosed, we had this little chemistry kit. You would collect the urine sample and then mix that with a tablet that created a little bubbling experiment and then you would hold it up to a chart. We did that several times a day but it really did not tell us very much information because the sugar that is in the urine really can be there over a number of hours where if you are testing sugar in the blood or in the subcutaneous space in the interstitial fluid, you are getting an immediate assessment of what the value is at that moment. So you can make much more informed decisions. The delivery of insulin has changed tremendously. I was on a couple of shots a day of insulin that really did not match up well with the foods that we were eating. One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do. And that has been something that has changed even over the last couple of years. So we are seeing, we saw a slow evolution over the last 30 years and then a really rapid evolution over the last 10 years in terms of delivery and monitoring. The relationship between someone with diabetes and their healthcare provider is really critical. It is so important to have a trusting and cooperative relationship to have success. The management of diabetes, unlike many, many health situations that we may encounter in the medical field, is one that is really managed primarily by the individual with diabetes on their own. I see someone with diabetes every three months or every six months in the office, but diabetes doesn't take a break during the times where they are not face-to-face with me. They are managing it minute-to-minute, day-to-day, making decisions that directly impact their diabetes control. And so building that trust and strengthening the person with diabetes knowledge and understanding of how diabetes is best managed really is critical. I feel like diabetes self-management is as critical as any aspect of diabetes management. And so if someone doesn't feel comfortable managing their own diabetes and doesn't trust that we have built up that knowledge and understanding, then they are really not going to have the same success as someone who feels confident and comfortable making decisions and adjusting the way they manage day-to-day. I really try to build trust and the foundation of a cooperative relationship with every patient that I see. I think it certainly helps that I have type 1 diabetes, and I don't keep that a secret. I tell people about it because I think it helps to build that trust. They can look across the table and see someone who has experienced many of the same situations that they've experienced, has an understanding of the trials and tribulations, the struggles that they may have gone through in their lifetime. I think the empathy that I can offer is really a strength that I have in terms of my interaction with individuals with type 1 diabetes. And I think that makes someone with diabetes more confident and more able to manage their diabetes both independently and in cooperation with myself. I really feel like that's a critical aspect of diabetes management. You know, I think in terms of the evolution of diabetes management, I think the automated insulin delivery platforms, using a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump together has really been one of the most important steps forward in diabetes management, taking away the minute-to-minute burden from those of us with diabetes while also improving the outcomes that we're getting has been such an important step forward."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

I was on a couple of shots a day of insulin that really did not match up well with the foods that we were eating. One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do. And that has been something that has changed even over the last couple of years. So we are seeing, we saw a slow evolution over the last 30 years and then a really rapid evolution over the last 10 years in terms of delivery and monitoring. The relationship between someone with diabetes and their healthcare provider is really critical. It is so important to have a trusting and cooperative relationship to have success. The management of diabetes, unlike many, many health situations that we may encounter in the medical field, is one that is really managed primarily by the individual with diabetes on their own. I see someone with diabetes every three months or every six months in the office, but diabetes doesn't take a break during the times where they are not face-to-face with me. They are managing it minute-to-minute, day-to-day, making decisions that directly impact their diabetes control. And so building that trust and strengthening the person with diabetes knowledge and understanding of how diabetes is best managed really is critical. I feel like diabetes self-management is as critical as any aspect of diabetes management. And so if someone doesn't feel comfortable managing their own diabetes and doesn't trust that we have built up that knowledge and understanding, then they are really not going to have the same success as someone who feels confident and comfortable making decisions and adjusting the way they manage day-to-day. I really try to build trust and the foundation of a cooperative relationship with every patient that I see. I think it certainly helps that I have type 1 diabetes, and I don't keep that a secret. I tell people about it because I think it helps to build that trust. They can look across the table and see someone who has experienced many of the same situations that they've experienced, has an understanding of the trials and tribulations, the struggles that they may have gone through in their lifetime. I think the empathy that I can offer is really a strength that I have in terms of my interaction with individuals with type 1 diabetes. And I think that makes someone with diabetes more confident and more able to manage their diabetes both independently and in cooperation with myself. I really feel like that's a critical aspect of diabetes management. You know, I think in terms of the evolution of diabetes management, I think the automated insulin delivery platforms, using a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump together has really been one of the most important steps forward in diabetes management, taking away the minute-to-minute burden from those of us with diabetes while also improving the outcomes that we're getting has been such an important step forward."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Prior to that time, type 1 diabetes was really essentially a death sentence for those who were diagnosed with it. There are some very famous pictures of young children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and really became emaciated and looked like they were close to death. Then afterwards, after they had received insulin, looked like healthy young children that they should have been. So, the discovery of insulin changed type 1 diabetes from something that really couldn't be managed to something that became the experience, really not what we have today because it has evolved so much over time, but it allowed people to at least live day to day and eat and participate in activities. It really changed it from something that you are counting the days to a situation where you could live with it. The care and management of type 1 diabetes has evolved tremendously since the time that I was diagnosed. It was 1978 and I was four years old when I was diagnosed. Fall and spring tend to be those times where it really peaks and I had that same experience. It was just after Halloween and right before Thanksgiving. At that time, we had just a very limited amount or number of different types of insulin. When I was diagnosed, we were using pork insulin and we were testing sugar in the urine rather than in the bloodstream or now with continuous glucose monitoring, the subcutaneous space. So it was really very limited in terms of how we were able to manage it. I initially took two shots of two different types of insulin per day and I really felt like looking back, the approach was we are going to give a lot of insulin at one time and then you have to kind of keep up with it throughout the day by eating. Whereas today, we give insulin to try to match what we are going to eat. So it is a much more physiologic approach. Rather than feeding the insulin, we are using the insulin to cover what we choose to eat. In terms of the monitoring of diabetes, I think that has been a tremendous not only improvement but just an evolution of the way we did it. Initially when I was diagnosed, we had this little chemistry kit. You would collect the urine sample and then mix that with a tablet that created a little bubbling experiment and then you would hold it up to a chart. We did that several times a day but it really did not tell us very much information because the sugar that is in the urine really can be there over a number of hours where if you are testing sugar in the blood or in the subcutaneous space in the interstitial fluid, you are getting an immediate assessment of what the value is at that moment.

Prior to that time, type 1 diabetes was really essentially a death sentence for those who were diagnosed with it. There are some very famous pictures of young children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and really became emaciated and looked like they were close to death. Then afterwards, after they had received insulin, looked like healthy young children that they should have been. So, the discovery of insulin changed type 1 diabetes from something that really couldn't be managed to something that became the experience, really not what we have today because it has evolved so much over time, but it allowed people to at least live day to day and eat and participate in activities. It really changed it from something that you are counting the days to a situation where you could live with it. The care and management of type 1 diabetes has evolved tremendously since the time that I was diagnosed. It was 1978 and I was four years old when I was diagnosed. Fall and spring tend to be those times where it really peaks and I had that same experience. It was just after Halloween and right before Thanksgiving. At that time, we had just a very limited amount or number of different types of insulin. When I was diagnosed, we were using pork insulin and we were testing sugar in the urine rather than in the bloodstream or now with continuous glucose monitoring, the subcutaneous space. So it was really very limited in terms of how we were able to manage it. I initially took two shots of two different types of insulin per day and I really felt like looking back, the approach was we are going to give a lot of insulin at one time and then you have to kind of keep up with it throughout the day by eating. Whereas today, we give insulin to try to match what we are going to eat. So it is a much more physiologic approach. Rather than feeding the insulin, we are using the insulin to cover what we choose to eat. In terms of the monitoring of diabetes, I think that has been a tremendous not only improvement but just an evolution of the way we did it. Initially when I was diagnosed, we had this little chemistry kit. You would collect the urine sample and then mix that with a tablet that created a little bubbling experiment and then you would hold it up to a chart. We did that several times a day but it really did not tell us very much information because the sugar that is in the urine really can be there over a number of hours where if you are testing sugar in the blood or in the subcutaneous space in the interstitial fluid, you are getting an immediate assessment of what the value is at that moment. So you can make much more informed decisions. The delivery of insulin has changed tremendously. I was on a couple of shots a day of insulin that really did not match up well with the foods that we were eating. One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do. And that has been something that has changed even over the last couple of years. So we are seeing, we saw a slow evolution over the last 30 years and then a really rapid evolution over the last 10 years in terms of delivery and monitoring. The relationship between someone with diabetes and their healthcare provider is really critical. It is so important to have a trusting and cooperative relationship to have success. The management of diabetes, unlike many, many health situations that we may encounter in the medical field, is one that is really managed primarily by the individual with diabetes on their own. I see someone with diabetes every three months or every six months in the office, but diabetes doesn't take a break during the times where they are not face-to-face with me. They are managing it minute-to-minute, day-to-day, making decisions that directly impact their diabetes control. And so building that trust and strengthening the person with diabetes knowledge and understanding of how diabetes is best managed really is critical. I feel like diabetes self-management is as critical as any aspect of diabetes management. And so if someone doesn't feel comfortable managing their own diabetes and doesn't trust that we have built up that knowledge and understanding, then they are really not going to have the same success as someone who feels confident and comfortable making decisions and adjusting the way they manage day-to-day. I really try to build trust and the foundation of a cooperative relationship with every patient that I see. I think it certainly helps that I have type 1 diabetes, and I don't keep that a secret. I tell people about it because I think it helps to build that trust. They can look across the table and see someone who has experienced many of the same situations that they've experienced, has an understanding of the trials and tribulations, the struggles that they may have gone through in their lifetime. I think the empathy that I can offer is really a strength that I have in terms of my interaction with individuals with type 1 diabetes. And I think that makes someone with diabetes more confident and more able to manage their diabetes both independently and in cooperation with myself. I really feel like that's a critical aspect of diabetes management.

One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do. And that has been something that has changed even over the last couple of years. So we are seeing, we saw a slow evolution over the last 30 years and then a really rapid evolution over the last 10 years in terms of delivery and monitoring. The relationship between someone with diabetes and their healthcare provider is really critical. It is so important to have a trusting and cooperative relationship to have success. The management of diabetes, unlike many, many health situations that we may encounter in the medical field, is one that is really managed primarily by the individual with diabetes on their own. I see someone with diabetes every three months or every six months in the office, but diabetes doesn't take a break during the times where they are not face-to-face with me. They are managing it minute-to-minute, day-to-day, making decisions that directly impact their diabetes control. And so building that trust and strengthening the person with diabetes knowledge and understanding of how diabetes is best managed really is critical. I feel like diabetes self-management is as critical as any aspect of diabetes management. And so if someone doesn't feel comfortable managing their own diabetes and doesn't trust that we have built up that knowledge and understanding, then they are really not going to have the same success as someone who feels confident and comfortable making decisions and adjusting the way they manage day-to-day. I really try to build trust and the foundation of a cooperative relationship with every patient that I see. I think it certainly helps that I have type 1 diabetes, and I don't keep that a secret. I tell people about it because I think it helps to build that trust. They can look across the table and see someone who has experienced many of the same situations that they've experienced, has an understanding of the trials and tribulations, the struggles that they may have gone through in their lifetime. I think the empathy that I can offer is really a strength that I have in terms of my interaction with individuals with type 1 diabetes. And I think that makes someone with diabetes more confident and more able to manage their diabetes both independently and in cooperation with myself. I really feel like that's a critical aspect of diabetes management. You know, I think in terms of the evolution of diabetes management, I think the automated insulin delivery platforms, using a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump together has really been one of the most important steps forward in diabetes management, taking away the minute-to-minute burden from those of us with diabetes while also improving the outcomes that we're getting has been such an important step forward."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Prior to that time, type 1 diabetes was really essentially a death sentence for those who were diagnosed with it. There are some very famous pictures of young children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and really became emaciated and looked like they were close to death. Then afterwards, after they had received insulin, looked like healthy young children that they should have been. So, the discovery of insulin changed type 1 diabetes from something that really couldn't be managed to something that became the experience, really not what we have today because it has evolved so much over time, but it allowed people to at least live day to day and eat and participate in activities. It really changed it from something that you are counting the days to a situation where you could live with it. The care and management of type 1 diabetes has evolved tremendously since the time that I was diagnosed. It was 1978 and I was four years old when I was diagnosed. Fall and spring tend to be those times where it really peaks and I had that same experience. It was just after Halloween and right before Thanksgiving. At that time, we had just a very limited amount or number of different types of insulin. When I was diagnosed, we were using pork insulin and we were testing sugar in the urine rather than in the bloodstream or now with continuous glucose monitoring, the subcutaneous space. So it was really very limited in terms of how we were able to manage it. I initially took two shots of two different types of insulin per day and I really felt like looking back, the approach was we are going to give a lot of insulin at one time and then you have to kind of keep up with it throughout the day by eating. Whereas today, we give insulin to try to match what we are going to eat. So it is a much more physiologic approach. Rather than feeding the insulin, we are using the insulin to cover what we choose to eat. In terms of the monitoring of diabetes, I think that has been a tremendous not only improvement but just an evolution of the way we did it. Initially when I was diagnosed, we had this little chemistry kit. You would collect the urine sample and then mix that with a tablet that created a little bubbling experiment and then you would hold it up to a chart. We did that several times a day but it really did not tell us very much information because the sugar that is in the urine really can be there over a number of hours where if you are testing sugar in the blood or in the subcutaneous space in the interstitial fluid, you are getting an immediate assessment of what the value is at that moment. So you can make much more informed decisions. The delivery of insulin has changed tremendously. I was on a couple of shots a day of insulin that really did not match up well with the foods that we were eating. One was sort of not, it did not last long enough and the other one did not have an onset that was quick enough and lasted a little bit too long. Now we have insulin that are very, very rapid in terms of their onset. So you can give insulin and have it match up with what you are eating. I use an insulin pump that delivers insulin and adjusts in real time based upon blood glucose trends without me having to do as much work as I used to do.

Firstly, it's important to make sure that the insulin is given to the right person as everyone's requirements are different. You should check their wristband to make sure. Secondly, there are many types of insulin so it's crucial to make sure you prescribe or administer the correct insulin for the patient. Insulin works differently, some quickly and some slowly. Insulin is a time critical drug so it's important to give it at the right time. Patients who are able should be encouraged to administer their own insulin and complete a self-administration of insulin assessment. The dose of insulin can vary depending on factors such as weight, diabetes type and activity levels and it can change over time. Right device, if insulin is being given using a syringe you need to ensure it is an insulin safety syringe. Insulin should only be withdrawn from an insulin vial, not a pre-filled pen or cartridge. Insulin is available in cartridges, pre-filled pens and vials. Some people use insulin pumps. Insulin should be injected at a 90 degree angle. You can use the upper outer thighs, abdomen, upper buttocks and back of the arms. The injection site should be varied to avoid lipohypertrophy or fatty lumps. The insulin pen needle should be changed every time insulin is administered. Finally, we encourage all staff to complete the insulin safety module on the DOT platform. It's important to use insulin safety and correctly to ensure the best possible care for our patients. To remind you, the six R's of insulin safety include the right person, right insulin, right time, right dose, right device and right way."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Firstly, it's important to make sure that the insulin is given to the right person as everyone's requirements are different. You should check their wristband to make sure. Secondly, there are many types of insulin so it's crucial to make sure you prescribe or administer the correct insulin for the patient. Insulin works differently, some quickly and some slowly. Insulin is a time critical drug so it's important to give it at the right time. Patients who are able should be encouraged to administer their own insulin and complete a self-administration of insulin assessment. The dose of insulin can vary depending on factors such as weight, diabetes type and activity levels and it can change over time. Right device, if insulin is being given using a syringe you need to ensure it is an insulin safety syringe. Insulin should only be withdrawn from an insulin vial, not a pre-filled pen or cartridge. Insulin is available in cartridges, pre-filled pens and vials. Some people use insulin pumps. Insulin should be injected at a 90 degree angle. You can use the upper outer thighs, abdomen, upper buttocks and back of the arms. The injection site should be varied to avoid lipohypertrophy or fatty lumps. The insulin pen needle should be changed every time insulin is administered. Finally, we encourage all staff to complete the insulin safety module on the DOT platform. It's important to use insulin safety and correctly to ensure the best possible care for our patients.

Well, you know, and the sun. Good morning class. Good morning. My name is Nurse Nancy. I'm going to be your nurse facilitator for today. We're going to go ahead and talk about the importance of insulin injections. What are we injecting? Insulin. I'm Priscilla Cutting and this is my friend Loretta Jones. Hi Loretta. Hi. Well, welcome both of you to my class. First let me go ahead and assess your understanding of insulin. Do you both know what it's used for? Excuse me nurse, can you please speak up just a little bit? Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use. There's correct dosing. It makes it more accurate, things like that. Can I see one of those please? Sure, you can. So small. It is small. It really does look like a chicken. And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it. So after you've chosen a correct site, like I was saying, your abdomen or the back of your arm, you want to go ahead and make sure that you have a clean site. You would use one of these alcohol wipes like this. All right. One for you. One for you. So using the site that you've chosen, you want to go ahead and clean it. My little alcohol swab. You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day. It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro. I don't know about this one right here. Hey. I'm okay. Okay."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it. So after you've chosen a correct site, like I was saying, your abdomen or the back of your arm, you want to go ahead and make sure that you have a clean site. You would use one of these alcohol wipes like this. All right. One for you. One for you. So using the site that you've chosen, you want to go ahead and clean it. My little alcohol swab. You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day. It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro. I don't know about this one right here. Hey. I'm okay. Okay."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Well, you know, and the sun. Good morning class. Good morning. My name is Nurse Nancy. I'm going to be your nurse facilitator for today. We're going to go ahead and talk about the importance of insulin injections. What are we injecting? Insulin. I'm Priscilla Cutting and this is my friend Loretta Jones. Hi Loretta. Hi. Well, welcome both of you to my class. First let me go ahead and assess your understanding of insulin. Do you both know what it's used for? Excuse me nurse, can you please speak up just a little bit? Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use.

I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. You go first. Uh-huh. My dosage is going to be fine. I'm going to unpack this needle. Okay. Very good. Same thing. Gosec. And? This side. Okay. That's not so bad. That wasn't. Not at all. Awesome. So what I would like for you guys to know that you're doing a great job. And can you show me the process one more time? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Good job ladies. You both did wonderful. I believe you now are experts at giving yourself insulin. I feel like a pro. I don't know about this one right here. Hey. I'm okay. Okay."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Well, you know, and the sun. Good morning class. Good morning. My name is Nurse Nancy. I'm going to be your nurse facilitator for today. We're going to go ahead and talk about the importance of insulin injections. What are we injecting? Insulin. I'm Priscilla Cutting and this is my friend Loretta Jones. Hi Loretta. Hi. Well, welcome both of you to my class. First let me go ahead and assess your understanding of insulin. Do you both know what it's used for? Excuse me nurse, can you please speak up just a little bit? Sure, no problem. I'll make sure to enunciate clearly. I think she wanted to know what is insulin used for. Oh, why we use it. That's easy. We're using it because we got sugar. The sugar, Loretta, you know they call it diabetes now. Sugar, diabetes, it's the same thing. Okay, so yes, that's the simple answer. Insulin works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood by helping it move into your cells. That way you have more energy. Okay, it does make sense. So that's why we inject. Yes, Ms. Jones, that is correct. Today I'm going to go ahead and teach you how to administer it yourselves. So let's get started. I've been teaching this class for about five years now. It's a little different now before I used to teach my students about using syringes, but now we don't have to do that because now we have the insulin pins. It's a little bit easier to use. There's correct dosing. It makes it more accurate, things like that. Can I see one of those please? Sure, you can. So small. It is small. It really does look like a chicken. And what I understand is how are we really going to use this to inject it because look, it's flat. Look, look, Priscilla. Okay, all right, all right. Give me that. Give me that. Let's refocus, ladies. She started it. Thank you. The needle you use to inject the insulin is covered. You have to un-twist the cap first like this before injecting it. You should make sure that your hands are clean and you should also choose an appropriate site. This is very important. Why is that important? Well, it's important because you're used to a needle one and in two it may hurt. So it's best to choose a site that has a lot of fatty tissue, places like your abdomen and the back of your arm. Oh, that sounds painful. And why wouldn't you just do it in the same spot every time? No, actually that's not the best thing to do. It's best to rotate sites. If you use the same site every time, that site may become hard and... Well, if it becomes hard, then you feel it less. Am I right? Right? That's so smart. True, but we actually don't want that. If that spot becomes hard, that means that the insulin, when injected, won't absorb into your body. The glucose will just remain in your blood. So it's best to go ahead and rotate sites and it will be like you... It'll be a little easier. It'll be a little easier. That's definitely no good. Exactly. So we don't want that. I'm going to go ahead and allow you guys to see it. So after you've chosen a correct site, like I was saying, your abdomen or the back of your arm, you want to go ahead and make sure that you have a clean site. You would use one of these alcohol wipes like this. All right. One for you. One for you. So using the site that you've chosen, you want to go ahead and clean it. My little alcohol swab. You want to go ahead and clean it. Clean the site and make sure it's dry. While it's dry, you want to go ahead and make sure you have the correct dosing. Twist the pin and change it to the numbers that, you know, the correct doses you would like to go ahead and use. Here you go. Okay. There you are. And you said 10? I didn't say 10, but 10 sounds good. Just for practice, go ahead. Well, I don't see any numbers on here. Well, actually, Miss Cunnane, it would be a lot easier if you had your glasses on. Oh, I would if I had them, but I've been looking everywhere and I can't find them. Priscilla, spin it right on top of your head. Oh, my word. I've been looking for these all day. It's okay, Miss Cunnane. It happens to the best of us. Okay, you both go ahead and twist your pins to 10 units. I got it now. Okay, great. So we aren't really injecting ourselves. I'll just go ahead and demonstrate. That needs that? Awesome. You find your site, you clean it, and you're going to go in at a 90-degree angle, hit the back of the pin, and hold it for a couple seconds, and then withdraw. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you show us that one more time? Sure. You encap your pin. You go into the site that you've chosen, hit the back of the pin, hold it for a couple seconds, then withdraw. Oh, okay. There you go. That doesn't sound so bad. So now it's your turn. Where is this one? You set the back of your arm you want to use. It's okay. Now your turn. Do you think you can do that? Yes. This is easy. Awesome. Seems easy enough. Alrighty. I love when my patients feel confident, right, in doing the procedure. So what sites will you be choosing today? Excuse me, what did you say? I asked what sites will you be using today? I'm going to go ahead and use my abdomen that's so close. I think I'll just use the back of my arm. Okay, awesome. Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay.
