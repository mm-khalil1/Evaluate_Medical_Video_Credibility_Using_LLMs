Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, my name is Jessica. I'm one of the Diabetes Specialist Nurses for the Aintree site. This is a demonstration video on how to administer insulin safely to your patients on the ward. So, firstly, we want to identify the correct type of needle. If you're administering insulin to a patient as a third party, safety needles must always be used. Now, on the Aintree site, we use a slightly different safety needle to the Royal and Broad green site. However, the principles of use are the exact same for them all. On the Aintree site, we use these ClickStart safety needles and on the Royal site and the Broad green site, we use Microdock needles. So, what you want to do is obviously get your insulin and ensure you're following the correct meds management policy and it's the right patient, the right time, the right medication, the right route and make sure obviously you've checked their allergies. So, what I would want to do is apply the needle. If I just come closer, you peel off the lid and you just screw it on to the end of the pen as such. So, you can see that's now attached and what I want to do is remove this clear cap. Now, you can see that the needle is not exposed to that point, it's completely covered up but you can see it through the blue cap. So, I want to make sure the needle is attached to the pen correctly. So, I'm just going to dial up a couple of units and do what we call an air shot. So, I could see that that has come out. So, I know that when I administer the dose to the patient, they are going to get the full dose because it's connected correctly. So, if my patient was on 10 units, what I want to do is dial up to the number 10 as shown. Now, the correct injection sites are the stomach, the legs and the underarms. So, you want to be injecting into the subcutaneous layer of fat and when you inject, you want to be rotating around to different sites to avoid any build up of insulin or any pockets causing any lumps or bumps. So, on here, I'll use a demonstration stomach. So, you want to be injecting onto bare skin. You don't need to clean it before, the patient should be suitably clean and what you want to do is be feeling for the area first to make sure there is no lumps and bumps deciding that that's the area you want to inject into. And then what you want to do is go in at a 90 degree angle as shown and just go directly into the skin and make sure it punctures and then all you do is gently press down on the insulin pen until it goes back down to zero. Once it's back down at zero, you count to 10. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and what you want to then do is release the needle away from the skin. So, you can see now on this safety needle that there's a cover come over the needle and this cover is red and that will stop any sharp injuries and then what you can do is remove the needle off the pen as such and pop it straight into your sharps. You never really need to worry that your patient has not received the full dose of insulin. You would see a large volume of liquid come out if they had not received it. It's perfectly normal to see a small dot of liquid next to the injection site as with any injection. It is also normal sometimes to get a small bruise or a little dot of blood. That might just be if you've hit a little blood vessel. It shouldn't cause any trouble to the patients and should go within a few days. Now, patients should not use safety needles. It's really important because they might not have the correct technique. They might not apply the right pressure which means they might not be getting the insulin as it's prescribed with the doses as it's prescribed. If patients are able to, they need to fill out the correct self-medication forms on the ward and be assessed as competent and then what they can do is administer their own insulin. So these would be the types of needles that the patients would use if they were going to administer it themselves. So you can see it looks very similar. You peel off your cap as such, screw it on to the end of the pen until it's locked in position. Take off your first cap and then your second cap and obviously you can see there this tiny little needle and obviously that's an exposed needle which is why as a healthcare professional we would never want to use that as it's very high risk of sharps to us. If patients were using it themselves, that's perfectly safe. So the same technique where they would dial up a couple of units, do an air shot, you can see that the liquid has come out there so then they would dial up to their correct dose. So they're going to be on 10 units as well and what they would do is inject again the exact same injection technique, 90 degree angle onto Clean Skin in the correct site and you just go directly in and press it down until it goes back down to zero as shown. Then count to 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We would remove it. As you can see that needle is still exposed. As it's a non-safety needle so then what the patient will need is their own little sharp spoon which should be at the end of their bed or available to them when they're administering. They can apply the cap back on and screw it off of the pen and dispose of it as such and they're sharp too. If you ever have any worries or questions or concerns regarding administering insulin please always speak to your diabetes teams on the appropriate site. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Once it's back down at zero, you count to 10. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and what you want to then do is release the needle away from the skin. So, you can see now on this safety needle that there's a cover come over the needle and this cover is red and that will stop any sharp injuries and then what you can do is remove the needle off the pen as such and pop it straight into your sharps. You never really need to worry that your patient has not received the full dose of insulin. You would see a large volume of liquid come out if they had not received it. It's perfectly normal to see a small dot of liquid next to the injection site as with any injection. It is also normal sometimes to get a small bruise or a little dot of blood. That might just be if you've hit a little blood vessel. It shouldn't cause any trouble to the patients and should go within a few days. Now, patients should not use safety needles. It's really important because they might not have the correct technique. They might not apply the right pressure which means they might not be getting the insulin as it's prescribed with the doses as it's prescribed. If patients are able to, they need to fill out the correct self-medication forms on the ward and be assessed as competent and then what they can do is administer their own insulin. So these would be the types of needles that the patients would use if they were going to administer it themselves. So you can see it looks very similar. You peel off your cap as such, screw it on to the end of the pen until it's locked in position. Take off your first cap and then your second cap and obviously you can see there this tiny little needle and obviously that's an exposed needle which is why as a healthcare professional we would never want to use that as it's very high risk of sharps to us. If patients were using it themselves, that's perfectly safe. So the same technique where they would dial up a couple of units, do an air shot, you can see that the liquid has come out there so then they would dial up to their correct dose. So they're going to be on 10 units as well and what they would do is inject again the exact same injection technique, 90 degree angle onto Clean Skin in the correct site and you just go directly in and press it down until it goes back down to zero as shown. Then count to 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We would remove it. As you can see that needle is still exposed. As it's a non-safety needle so then what the patient will need is their own little sharp spoon which should be at the end of their bed or available to them when they're administering. They can apply the cap back on and screw it off of the pen and dispose of it as such and they're sharp too. If you ever have any worries or questions or concerns regarding administering insulin please always speak to your diabetes teams on the appropriate site. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, my name is Jessica. I'm one of the Diabetes Specialist Nurses for the Aintree site. This is a demonstration video on how to administer insulin safely to your patients on the ward. So, firstly, we want to identify the correct type of needle. If you're administering insulin to a patient as a third party, safety needles must always be used. Now, on the Aintree site, we use a slightly different safety needle to the Royal and Broad green site. However, the principles of use are the exact same for them all. On the Aintree site, we use these ClickStart safety needles and on the Royal site and the Broad green site, we use Microdock needles. So, what you want to do is obviously get your insulin and ensure you're following the correct meds management policy and it's the right patient, the right time, the right medication, the right route and make sure obviously you've checked their allergies. So, what I would want to do is apply the needle. If I just come closer, you peel off the lid and you just screw it on to the end of the pen as such. So, you can see that's now attached and what I want to do is remove this clear cap. Now, you can see that the needle is not exposed to that point, it's completely covered up but you can see it through the blue cap. So, I want to make sure the needle is attached to the pen correctly. So, I'm just going to dial up a couple of units and do what we call an air shot. So, I could see that that has come out. So, I know that when I administer the dose to the patient, they are going to get the full dose because it's connected correctly. So, if my patient was on 10 units, what I want to do is dial up to the number 10 as shown. Now, the correct injection sites are the stomach, the legs and the underarms. So, you want to be injecting into the subcutaneous layer of fat and when you inject, you want to be rotating around to different sites to avoid any build up of insulin or any pockets causing any lumps or bumps. So, on here, I'll use a demonstration stomach. So, you want to be injecting onto bare skin. You don't need to clean it before, the patient should be suitably clean and what you want to do is be feeling for the area first to make sure there is no lumps and bumps deciding that that's the area you want to inject into. And then what you want to do is go in at a 90 degree angle as shown and just go directly into the skin and make sure it punctures and then all you do is gently press down on the insulin pen until it goes back down to zero. Once it's back down at zero, you count to 10. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and what you want to then do is release the needle away from the skin.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, my name is Jessica. I'm one of the Diabetes Specialist Nurses for the Aintree site. This is a demonstration video on how to administer insulin safely to your patients on the ward. So, firstly, we want to identify the correct type of needle. If you're administering insulin to a patient as a third party, safety needles must always be used. Now, on the Aintree site, we use a slightly different safety needle to the Royal and Broad green site. However, the principles of use are the exact same for them all. On the Aintree site, we use these ClickStart safety needles and on the Royal site and the Broad green site, we use Microdock needles. So, what you want to do is obviously get your insulin and ensure you're following the correct meds management policy and it's the right patient, the right time, the right medication, the right route and make sure obviously you've checked their allergies. So, what I would want to do is apply the needle. If I just come closer, you peel off the lid and you just screw it on to the end of the pen as such. So, you can see that's now attached and what I want to do is remove this clear cap. Now, you can see that the needle is not exposed to that point, it's completely covered up but you can see it through the blue cap. So, I want to make sure the needle is attached to the pen correctly. So, I'm just going to dial up a couple of units and do what we call an air shot. So, I could see that that has come out. So, I know that when I administer the dose to the patient, they are going to get the full dose because it's connected correctly. So, if my patient was on 10 units, what I want to do is dial up to the number 10 as shown. Now, the correct injection sites are the stomach, the legs and the underarms. So, you want to be injecting into the subcutaneous layer of fat and when you inject, you want to be rotating around to different sites to avoid any build up of insulin or any pockets causing any lumps or bumps. So, on here, I'll use a demonstration stomach. So, you want to be injecting onto bare skin. You don't need to clean it before, the patient should be suitably clean and what you want to do is be feeling for the area first to make sure there is no lumps and bumps deciding that that's the area you want to inject into. And then what you want to do is go in at a 90 degree angle as shown and just go directly into the skin and make sure it punctures and then all you do is gently press down on the insulin pen until it goes back down to zero. Once it's back down at zero, you count to 10. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and what you want to then do is release the needle away from the skin. So, you can see now on this safety needle that there's a cover come over the needle and this cover is red and that will stop any sharp injuries and then what you can do is remove the needle off the pen as such and pop it straight into your sharps. You never really need to worry that your patient has not received the full dose of insulin. You would see a large volume of liquid come out if they had not received it. It's perfectly normal to see a small dot of liquid next to the injection site as with any injection. It is also normal sometimes to get a small bruise or a little dot of blood. That might just be if you've hit a little blood vessel. It shouldn't cause any trouble to the patients and should go within a few days. Now, patients should not use safety needles. It's really important because they might not have the correct technique. They might not apply the right pressure which means they might not be getting the insulin as it's prescribed with the doses as it's prescribed. If patients are able to, they need to fill out the correct self-medication forms on the ward and be assessed as competent and then what they can do is administer their own insulin. So these would be the types of needles that the patients would use if they were going to administer it themselves. So you can see it looks very similar. You peel off your cap as such, screw it on to the end of the pen until it's locked in position. Take off your first cap and then your second cap and obviously you can see there this tiny little needle and obviously that's an exposed needle which is why as a healthcare professional we would never want to use that as it's very high risk of sharps to us. If patients were using it themselves, that's perfectly safe. So the same technique where they would dial up a couple of units, do an air shot, you can see that the liquid has come out there so then they would dial up to their correct dose. So they're going to be on 10 units as well and what they would do is inject again the exact same injection technique, 90 degree angle onto Clean Skin in the correct site and you just go directly in and press it down until it goes back down to zero as shown. Then count to 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We would remove it. As you can see that needle is still exposed. As it's a non-safety needle so then what the patient will need is their own little sharp spoon which should be at the end of their bed or available to them when they're administering. They can apply the cap back on and screw it off of the pen and dispose of it as such and they're sharp too.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: So where are the places that I can inject the insulin? So insulin can be injected in several different places. The most common place where you see people inject is actually in their abdomen. And when you go to the abdomen for a place to inject insulin, you want people to stay two fingers away from the belly button, because it's very sensitive there, and stay below the rib cage, but above the pelvis bone. So you can go from this side all the way across to this side. Another place to inject insulin is the arm, and it's the outer area of the arm back here. You want the insulin to go into the fat tissue. So we don't want it to go into the front of the arm here, where it has big blood vessels and it has more muscle, and we don't want it too close to the elbow. So you put one hand over the elbow, one hand over the shoulder. We don't want it to go into the muscle area here. So if I was measuring with you, I put one hand over the shoulder, one hand over the elbow, draw a line down the center, and I'm going to use the back part of your arm here. This back part right there. Insulin can also be injected into the leg, the thigh area. Again, I put one hand over my knee, one hand over my hip, pretend you see a crease in your pants, and you go to the outside part of your leg, not the inside part of the leg. Even though there's lots of flesh you can pinch up on the inside part of the leg, there's too many blood vessels there, and there's too many nerve endings there. It's not the best place. So you always go to the outside part of the leg. Additionally, there's some people who inject insulin into the buttock area back here, so that can be used as well, this buttock area. However, it's very awkward to reach that spot as it is with this. It can be awkward to put it in. If I was to use my arm as an area where I did want to do it myself, I'm using an insulin pen. One strategy would be to put my arm on the top of a chair and then roll my arm forward. And now this is nice and tight, just as if I was pinching it myself, and I could put the insulin in like that. Why is it that we don't want it to go into the muscle or close to the blood vessels? Because each of these insulins works for a specific time, and when we put the insulin into the fat area, what happens is we get that expected action of the insulin. Whereas if we put it into muscle tissue, muscle tissue has more blood vessels running through it, and the more exercise a person does increases that blood flow, which then will change the absorption of the insulin. And when you put it into fat tissue, we get a much more consistent, expected, predictable absorption of the insulin. So if I was to use this pen device, and I was going to inject myself, so I would have my insulin all ready to go, and in this case there's no actual insulin in here, what I would do is I'd get my pen ready, I'd have my dose ready, and I would select my area where I want to inject the insulin, and I want to pinch the skin up and the fat up so that I can pull it away from that fat tissue. For this pen, I'm going to put the needle straight in. When I put the needle in, I can let go of the pinch, and I can push to dispense the insulin. I'm at zero now, so I'm going to leave the needle in here for a count of six seconds so that all the insulin can get absorbed. One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand, six one thousand. And now I'm going to pull the needle straight out again. Was it painful? No, I felt a little poke, but it didn't hurt. So for those of us who are afraid of the needle, is there a trick to building up courage to use it? That's a common question, and most people, I'd say 99% of the people who take an insulin injection, they'll tell me the needle poke for their finger blood testing actually hurts more than does this particular needle. So it doesn't matter if you go the needle in quickly or the needle in slowly, you can do either or. One way is not better than the other. You can put the needle in and then push the plunger down until all the insulin is being given, and then pull the needle out. For people who are super cautious of the insulin and what it might feel like to poke the needle in, some people I've advised they might try using an ice cube on their skin. And the ice cube, if they rub it there first, it tends to make the skin cold and a little bit cool, and so then they can poke the needle in and they tend not to feel it. Should I clean the spot where I'm going to inject the needle into? No, you don't actually need to use an alcohol wipe on your skin first. Every time when you use a brand new insulin needle, that needle is completely... ...sterile. ...sterile, and your skin, as long as you've been showering regularly and have clean skin, then you're not going to get an infection there. Times when you might want to use an alcohol wipe is maybe we're out camping and you can't have a fresh shower every day, you might want to use an alcohol wipe then. If somebody was immunosuppressed, say they're on steroids or they're on anti-rejection drugs, they might choose to use an alcohol wipe first. But there's no data that actually shows by using an alcohol wipe that you're actually preventing infections on your skin from an insulin injection at the time. If people are in the hospital, because there can be a number of bacteria and infections around, nurses will often use an alcohol wipe in that situation, but for home use, an alcohol wipe is not necessary."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

One strategy would be to put my arm on the top of a chair and then roll my arm forward. And now this is nice and tight, just as if I was pinching it myself, and I could put the insulin in like that. Why is it that we don't want it to go into the muscle or close to the blood vessels? Because each of these insulins works for a specific time, and when we put the insulin into the fat area, what happens is we get that expected action of the insulin. Whereas if we put it into muscle tissue, muscle tissue has more blood vessels running through it, and the more exercise a person does increases that blood flow, which then will change the absorption of the insulin. And when you put it into fat tissue, we get a much more consistent, expected, predictable absorption of the insulin. So if I was to use this pen device, and I was going to inject myself, so I would have my insulin all ready to go, and in this case there's no actual insulin in here, what I would do is I'd get my pen ready, I'd have my dose ready, and I would select my area where I want to inject the insulin, and I want to pinch the skin up and the fat up so that I can pull it away from that fat tissue. For this pen, I'm going to put the needle straight in. When I put the needle in, I can let go of the pinch, and I can push to dispense the insulin. I'm at zero now, so I'm going to leave the needle in here for a count of six seconds so that all the insulin can get absorbed. One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand, six one thousand. And now I'm going to pull the needle straight out again. Was it painful? No, I felt a little poke, but it didn't hurt. So for those of us who are afraid of the needle, is there a trick to building up courage to use it? That's a common question, and most people, I'd say 99% of the people who take an insulin injection, they'll tell me the needle poke for their finger blood testing actually hurts more than does this particular needle. So it doesn't matter if you go the needle in quickly or the needle in slowly, you can do either or. One way is not better than the other. You can put the needle in and then push the plunger down until all the insulin is being given, and then pull the needle out. For people who are super cautious of the insulin and what it might feel like to poke the needle in, some people I've advised they might try using an ice cube on their skin. And the ice cube, if they rub it there first, it tends to make the skin cold and a little bit cool, and so then they can poke the needle in and they tend not to feel it. Should I clean the spot where I'm going to inject the needle into? No, you don't actually need to use an alcohol wipe on your skin first. Every time when you use a brand new insulin needle, that needle is completely... ...sterile. ...sterile, and your skin, as long as you've been showering regularly and have clean skin, then you're not going to get an infection there. Times when you might want to use an alcohol wipe is maybe we're out camping and you can't have a fresh shower every day, you might want to use an alcohol wipe then. If somebody was immunosuppressed, say they're on steroids or they're on anti-rejection drugs, they might choose to use an alcohol wipe first. But there's no data that actually shows by using an alcohol wipe that you're actually preventing infections on your skin from an insulin injection at the time. If people are in the hospital, because there can be a number of bacteria and infections around, nurses will often use an alcohol wipe in that situation, but for home use, an alcohol wipe is not necessary."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

The most common place where you see people inject is actually in their abdomen. And when you go to the abdomen for a place to inject insulin, you want people to stay two fingers away from the belly button, because it's very sensitive there, and stay below the rib cage, but above the pelvis bone. So you can go from this side all the way across to this side. Another place to inject insulin is the arm, and it's the outer area of the arm back here. You want the insulin to go into the fat tissue. So we don't want it to go into the front of the arm here, where it has big blood vessels and it has more muscle, and we don't want it too close to the elbow. So you put one hand over the elbow, one hand over the shoulder. We don't want it to go into the muscle area here. So if I was measuring with you, I put one hand over the shoulder, one hand over the elbow, draw a line down the center, and I'm going to use the back part of your arm here. This back part right there. Insulin can also be injected into the leg, the thigh area. Again, I put one hand over my knee, one hand over my hip, pretend you see a crease in your pants, and you go to the outside part of your leg, not the inside part of the leg. Even though there's lots of flesh you can pinch up on the inside part of the leg, there's too many blood vessels there, and there's too many nerve endings there. It's not the best place.

That's a common question, and most people, I'd say 99% of the people who take an insulin injection, they'll tell me the needle poke for their finger blood testing actually hurts more than does this particular needle. So it doesn't matter if you go the needle in quickly or the needle in slowly, you can do either or. One way is not better than the other. You can put the needle in and then push the plunger down until all the insulin is being given, and then pull the needle out. For people who are super cautious of the insulin and what it might feel like to poke the needle in, some people I've advised they might try using an ice cube on their skin. And the ice cube, if they rub it there first, it tends to make the skin cold and a little bit cool, and so then they can poke the needle in and they tend not to feel it. Should I clean the spot where I'm going to inject the needle into? No, you don't actually need to use an alcohol wipe on your skin first. Every time when you use a brand new insulin needle, that needle is completely... ...sterile. ...sterile, and your skin, as long as you've been showering regularly and have clean skin, then you're not going to get an infection there.

But there's no data that actually shows by using an alcohol wipe that you're actually preventing infections on your skin from an insulin injection at the time.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: So where are the places that I can inject the insulin? So insulin can be injected in several different places. The most common place where you see people inject is actually in their abdomen. And when you go to the abdomen for a place to inject insulin, you want people to stay two fingers away from the belly button, because it's very sensitive there, and stay below the rib cage, but above the pelvis bone. So you can go from this side all the way across to this side. Another place to inject insulin is the arm, and it's the outer area of the arm back here. You want the insulin to go into the fat tissue. So we don't want it to go into the front of the arm here, where it has big blood vessels and it has more muscle, and we don't want it too close to the elbow. So you put one hand over the elbow, one hand over the shoulder. We don't want it to go into the muscle area here. So if I was measuring with you, I put one hand over the shoulder, one hand over the elbow, draw a line down the center, and I'm going to use the back part of your arm here. This back part right there. Insulin can also be injected into the leg, the thigh area. Again, I put one hand over my knee, one hand over my hip, pretend you see a crease in your pants, and you go to the outside part of your leg, not the inside part of the leg. Even though there's lots of flesh you can pinch up on the inside part of the leg, there's too many blood vessels there, and there's too many nerve endings there. It's not the best place. So you always go to the outside part of the leg. Additionally, there's some people who inject insulin into the buttock area back here, so that can be used as well, this buttock area. However, it's very awkward to reach that spot as it is with this. It can be awkward to put it in. If I was to use my arm as an area where I did want to do it myself, I'm using an insulin pen. One strategy would be to put my arm on the top of a chair and then roll my arm forward. And now this is nice and tight, just as if I was pinching it myself, and I could put the insulin in like that. Why is it that we don't want it to go into the muscle or close to the blood vessels? Because each of these insulins works for a specific time, and when we put the insulin into the fat area, what happens is we get that expected action of the insulin. Whereas if we put it into muscle tissue, muscle tissue has more blood vessels running through it, and the more exercise a person does increases that blood flow, which then will change the absorption of the insulin. And when you put it into fat tissue, we get a much more consistent, expected, predictable absorption of the insulin. So if I was to use this pen device, and I was going to inject myself, so I would have my insulin all ready to go, and in this case there's no actual insulin in here, what I would do is I'd get my pen ready, I'd have my dose ready, and I would select my area where I want to inject the insulin, and I want to pinch the skin up and the fat up so that I can pull it away from that fat tissue. For this pen, I'm going to put the needle straight in. When I put the needle in, I can let go of the pinch, and I can push to dispense the insulin. I'm at zero now, so I'm going to leave the needle in here for a count of six seconds so that all the insulin can get absorbed.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: So where are the places that I can inject the insulin? So insulin can be injected in several different places. The most common place where you see people inject is actually in their abdomen. And when you go to the abdomen for a place to inject insulin, you want people to stay two fingers away from the belly button, because it's very sensitive there, and stay below the rib cage, but above the pelvis bone. So you can go from this side all the way across to this side. Another place to inject insulin is the arm, and it's the outer area of the arm back here. You want the insulin to go into the fat tissue. So we don't want it to go into the front of the arm here, where it has big blood vessels and it has more muscle, and we don't want it too close to the elbow. So you put one hand over the elbow, one hand over the shoulder. We don't want it to go into the muscle area here. So if I was measuring with you, I put one hand over the shoulder, one hand over the elbow, draw a line down the center, and I'm going to use the back part of your arm here. This back part right there. Insulin can also be injected into the leg, the thigh area. Again, I put one hand over my knee, one hand over my hip, pretend you see a crease in your pants, and you go to the outside part of your leg, not the inside part of the leg. Even though there's lots of flesh you can pinch up on the inside part of the leg, there's too many blood vessels there, and there's too many nerve endings there. It's not the best place. So you always go to the outside part of the leg. Additionally, there's some people who inject insulin into the buttock area back here, so that can be used as well, this buttock area. However, it's very awkward to reach that spot as it is with this. It can be awkward to put it in. If I was to use my arm as an area where I did want to do it myself, I'm using an insulin pen. One strategy would be to put my arm on the top of a chair and then roll my arm forward. And now this is nice and tight, just as if I was pinching it myself, and I could put the insulin in like that. Why is it that we don't want it to go into the muscle or close to the blood vessels? Because each of these insulins works for a specific time, and when we put the insulin into the fat area, what happens is we get that expected action of the insulin. Whereas if we put it into muscle tissue, muscle tissue has more blood vessels running through it, and the more exercise a person does increases that blood flow, which then will change the absorption of the insulin. And when you put it into fat tissue, we get a much more consistent, expected, predictable absorption of the insulin. So if I was to use this pen device, and I was going to inject myself, so I would have my insulin all ready to go, and in this case there's no actual insulin in here, what I would do is I'd get my pen ready, I'd have my dose ready, and I would select my area where I want to inject the insulin, and I want to pinch the skin up and the fat up so that I can pull it away from that fat tissue. For this pen, I'm going to put the needle straight in. When I put the needle in, I can let go of the pinch, and I can push to dispense the insulin. I'm at zero now, so I'm going to leave the needle in here for a count of six seconds so that all the insulin can get absorbed. One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand, six one thousand. And now I'm going to pull the needle straight out again. Was it painful? No, I felt a little poke, but it didn't hurt. So for those of us who are afraid of the needle, is there a trick to building up courage to use it? That's a common question, and most people, I'd say 99% of the people who take an insulin injection, they'll tell me the needle poke for their finger blood testing actually hurts more than does this particular needle. So it doesn't matter if you go the needle in quickly or the needle in slowly, you can do either or. One way is not better than the other. You can put the needle in and then push the plunger down until all the insulin is being given, and then pull the needle out. For people who are super cautious of the insulin and what it might feel like to poke the needle in, some people I've advised they might try using an ice cube on their skin. And the ice cube, if they rub it there first, it tends to make the skin cold and a little bit cool, and so then they can poke the needle in and they tend not to feel it. Should I clean the spot where I'm going to inject the needle into? No, you don't actually need to use an alcohol wipe on your skin first. Every time when you use a brand new insulin needle, that needle is completely... ...sterile. ...sterile, and your skin, as long as you've been showering regularly and have clean skin, then you're not going to get an infection there. Times when you might want to use an alcohol wipe is maybe we're out camping and you can't have a fresh shower every day, you might want to use an alcohol wipe then. If somebody was immunosuppressed, say they're on steroids or they're on anti-rejection drugs, they might choose to use an alcohol wipe first. But there's no data that actually shows by using an alcohol wipe that you're actually preventing infections on your skin from an insulin injection at the time.

I wanted to jump in today and as you know I've been MDI for a couple weeks now and I wanted to give you guys a little review on the InPen that I've been using. Actually, not really a review. This is more of an instructional video. So this is the InPen created by Companion Medical and no, it is not sponsored by them because I wanted to make sure this is an unbiased video series, right? So everything is my own words. I'm going to tell you how you can change out the cartridges. So you can see that there. If it focuses, boop. Come on, focus, focus, focus. There we go. So you need cartridges if you want to be using these things and it's very similar to an insulin pen, like a Humalog pen that I used to use when I was first diagnosed. But I didn't know how to change out the cartridge my first time and so I had to look it up on YouTube and so I'm making a YouTube video. What's up? The interesting thing I want to note about these things that InPen could really improve upon is there's no way to tell when it's actually going to end. So you can see there, hopefully, this is an empty cartridge. You can see that red line. It's kind of a guessing game where we have this red line. It's like, okay, there's probably maybe five units left, but here's the thing. This one ran out halfway through a breakfast dose. So I had to go figure out how to change the cartridge real quick, go change it, and then go deliver the rest of my dose with the new cartridge. So InPen, if you're listening, I would love to have that feature added somehow. But outside of that awesome little tool we have. And so what I want to show you first off is that red line right there is how you know when the insulin is going to run out. That's the only indicator you have. So you kind of have to eyeball it. But when the time does come, very simple to take this out. So what you're going to do, you have the InPen here, right? Mine's blue. Take off the cap, chuck it. Just kidding. Put it somewhere safe. You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose. Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right? Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right? Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: What's going on guys? I wanted to jump in today and as you know I've been MDI for a couple weeks now and I wanted to give you guys a little review on the InPen that I've been using. Actually, not really a review. This is more of an instructional video. So this is the InPen created by Companion Medical and no, it is not sponsored by them because I wanted to make sure this is an unbiased video series, right? So everything is my own words. I'm going to tell you how you can change out the cartridges. So you can see that there. If it focuses, boop. Come on, focus, focus, focus. There we go. So you need cartridges if you want to be using these things and it's very similar to an insulin pen, like a Humalog pen that I used to use when I was first diagnosed. But I didn't know how to change out the cartridge my first time and so I had to look it up on YouTube and so I'm making a YouTube video. What's up? The interesting thing I want to note about these things that InPen could really improve upon is there's no way to tell when it's actually going to end. So you can see there, hopefully, this is an empty cartridge. You can see that red line. It's kind of a guessing game where we have this red line. It's like, okay, there's probably maybe five units left, but here's the thing. This one ran out halfway through a breakfast dose. So I had to go figure out how to change the cartridge real quick, go change it, and then go deliver the rest of my dose with the new cartridge. So InPen, if you're listening, I would love to have that feature added somehow. But outside of that awesome little tool we have. And so what I want to show you first off is that red line right there is how you know when the insulin is going to run out. That's the only indicator you have. So you kind of have to eyeball it. But when the time does come, very simple to take this out. So what you're going to do, you have the InPen here, right? Mine's blue. Take off the cap, chuck it. Just kidding. Put it somewhere safe. You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose.

Those could be counted as doses if you're not careful and it's going to tell you you have 10 units of insulin on board and you're like, but I didn't give any insulin yet. That's where it gets confusing if you don't know what you're doing. So I'm going to explain this to you. When you go into the app, you go into your log book, you tap on that delivery and you say, Hey, this was a prime, not a dose. And it goes, Oh, okay, cool. Problem solved. So if you let the app know those were primes, you were just trying to get the insulin out, then you're all good to go. And then anytime you give a dose, make sure it registers as a dose, which it will automatically. And this thing's pretty darn smart. If you prime before an injection, it automatically counts it as a prime. If it's like you prime a unit and then you give eight units, it's like, Oh, the unit before must've been a prime cause they gave a second dose of eight units. It's pretty sweet. So, um, that is how you change a cartridge on your in pen. And I'll do a full review later on, but it's pretty sweet. That's how you change the cartridge piece and make sure insulin's coming out the needle. That's pretty much it. So hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: What's going on guys? I wanted to jump in today and as you know I've been MDI for a couple weeks now and I wanted to give you guys a little review on the InPen that I've been using. Actually, not really a review. This is more of an instructional video. So this is the InPen created by Companion Medical and no, it is not sponsored by them because I wanted to make sure this is an unbiased video series, right? So everything is my own words. I'm going to tell you how you can change out the cartridges. So you can see that there. If it focuses, boop. Come on, focus, focus, focus. There we go. So you need cartridges if you want to be using these things and it's very similar to an insulin pen, like a Humalog pen that I used to use when I was first diagnosed. But I didn't know how to change out the cartridge my first time and so I had to look it up on YouTube and so I'm making a YouTube video. What's up? The interesting thing I want to note about these things that InPen could really improve upon is there's no way to tell when it's actually going to end. So you can see there, hopefully, this is an empty cartridge. You can see that red line. It's kind of a guessing game where we have this red line. It's like, okay, there's probably maybe five units left, but here's the thing. This one ran out halfway through a breakfast dose. So I had to go figure out how to change the cartridge real quick, go change it, and then go deliver the rest of my dose with the new cartridge. So InPen, if you're listening, I would love to have that feature added somehow. But outside of that awesome little tool we have. And so what I want to show you first off is that red line right there is how you know when the insulin is going to run out. That's the only indicator you have. So you kind of have to eyeball it. But when the time does come, very simple to take this out. So what you're going to do, you have the InPen here, right? Mine's blue. Take off the cap, chuck it. Just kidding. Put it somewhere safe. You have your cartridge there. Now this one's not empty, but I'm going to go ahead and do this for you guys. Hopefully it doesn't mess it up. You're going to twist a tiny bit and then it comes across or comes out. Check that out. So this is the plunger. So when we do that, this is getting pushed through and this is your insulin cartridge inside of a plastic container. See that? So now we're back to like the other one looks like. As you can see, I have a lot of insulin left in there, a lot of decent amount. So we're going to keep that in there. But if I were to change it out, I would come over here, I would grab my other one, right? And we'll just pretend, you know, I'll switch it up for you guys. We'll pretend that the empty one is my new cartridge. What I would do, slip it in there. I would rewind this. So here's how you do it. You grab the plunger, you grab the other end and you twist it all the way till it's back up in here. Okay? Make that focus. There you go. So grab this and grab this. This is the plunger sides. You grab them, twist it all the way back in so it's right in there. Then when it's all the way back in, you put them back together and then twist until you hear a click. You guys hear that? All right, cool. Then you're going to have to prime it. That is key. Almost didn't prime it my first time. Priming means that plunger needs to catch up with where the insulin thing is. Obviously I'm great at terminology, right? So see this piece right here, that rubber piece in there? That's pushing the insulin out of the needle into you. So what needs to happen is the plunger, I'm going to take these parts so you guys can see I'm talking about. All right, so whoop, just dropped it. Oh well. This plunger needs to match up with this plunger and see it's going to push it, push it, push it, push it. And see it kind of lines up. It's going to keep pushing and that's how insulin gets into your body. This thing pushes the rubber stopper, which pushes insulin through the needle. So you have to prime this by doing little mini doses. I do two units at a time and until it catches up and insulin squirts out the top, then it's not matched up. So you have to make sure that happens. So I'm going to show you guys what I mean. So we have these pieces, right? We slip the insulin, the new cartridge in there. We put this together, wait for the click. There we go. And what you're going to do is grab your needle, fresh needle, going to put it on top there. And some insulin needles might be different depending on hemo log versus no, but like I think there's another option out there. Um, what you would do is take this off, take this off. So it's just a needle and you're going to prime, right? You know, I'll just do it. It's going to read this as a dose. I'll explain that in a second. So watch this one, two, and we've got insulin. Oh, come on. Focus, focus, focus, camera. There we go. See some insulin there. Yeah, they do. So now what I'm going to have to do, I'm dropping everything, is you're going to have to go into the app that you are connected to via Bluetooth and tell the app that was a prime and not a dose. Here's why it gets tricky and you should be aware of that. If you do a bunch of those in a row, cause the first time you change your cartridge, you're going to have to push through like five to 10 units until the plungers connect, right?
