Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hello, I'm Joshua Freitas. I'm going to be instructing a group of individuals about insulin administration. Now, this targeted audience is going to be very wide because anybody can be diagnosed as a diabetic and need to inject insulin due to their blood sugar being too high. So we're talking about insulin administration. This is for my nursing, teaching, and education class here. And like I said, I'm Joshua Freitas. Moving on here. What you want to look for when you're administering insulin or diabetic are signs of hypoglycemia. Now hypoglycemia is of course low blood sugar and this can include some symptoms such as shakiness, nervousness, or anxiety, sweating, chills, and clamminess, irritability or impatience, confusion including delirium, rapid fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or dizziness, hunger or nausea, sleepiness, blurred impaired vision, tingling or numbness of the lips and tongue, headaches, weakness or fatigue, anger, stubbornness or sadness, lack of coordination, nightmares or crying out during sleep, and if it gets too bad, seizures and unconsciousness. Now that's a huge list and you think, well you experience some of these on a daily basis anyway, but once you get more in tune to your blood sugar levels and how you feel during this, then you'll be able to narrow it down when you're likely to have to check your blood sugar at that time. Some signs of hyperglycemia of course on the other end of the spectrum are high blood sugar of course, hyper meaning high, high levels of sugar in the urine which you can usually smell, it'll smell sweet, frequent urination and increased thirst. Of course hypoglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is going to tend to hurt you in the long run whereas hypoglycemia can lead to coma and even death. So our supplies here are a bottle of insulin, we have a sterile insulin syringe, wrappers already removed, we have some alcohol wipes, it's important for sterilization, and a container used for disposal here, of course I'm just using a cardboard box but if you had one at your house it would have to be a sharps container to safely dispose of the needles. Alright so what we do is remove plastic from the needle, we're going to go ahead and roll our insulin and I'm just going to follow this, you would roll the insulin, get air bubbles out of it, if you're mixing insulins, which not everybody is going to have to do, you would kind of roll it to mix it, you don't want to shake it or agitate it too much because it'll get air bubbles in there and you don't want any of that. So then you're going to wipe off the rubber top of the insulin, it's important to note that some people are going to ask, you know, do they need to wash their hands or wear gloves, just wash your hands for these procedures. So set the insulin bottle on a flat surface like we have here. So now you'll remove your needle from your cap, be careful because that is a sharp needle, insert the needle into the rubber top of the insulin, right in the center. Now when you're inserting it into the rubber you need to make sure to use different areas of the rubber because if you insert it in the same area it's going to degrade the rubber. Turn it upside down and we're going to aspirate the needed amount of insulin, we're going to say 5 units based on our sliding scale here. Remove the needle and we're going to replace the cap. Now if you have a big container it's good to sometimes put in the amount of air and units into the bottle as the amount of insulin you're taking out so that you don't get too much negative pressure inside the bottle. But don't over inflate it all either. Okay so we're good on our aspiration here. Now we're going to talk about self administration, of course I'm not diabetic so I've brought this little pad here we're going to use. So what you want to do is use another alcohol pad and we're going to rub the site. This is always just to prevent infection here. Since I can't hold that and do this at the same time I'll remove our needle. We're going to pretend this is my belly. You'll pinch up about an inch of fat if you can here. Get the needle ready and what we're going to do is go in at a 90 degree angle just quickly. Pop it in there, we're going to inject the insulin in and then quickly pull out without rubbing and at this point you don't need to put the cap back on you can just throw it in your waist. And at that point if it's bleeding you can always just put a bandaid on or something it usually doesn't bleed I've noticed on patients but if it does a little bandaid will suffice. And that's it for the injection here. Any questions? And since I do not have an audience I've prepared five questions. Will the insulin injection hurt? Well yes it's likely to hurt initially but as you do it it's going to become less of a pain for you. You're going to be used to it at that point. So yes it may sting a little bit at first but the insulin is not going to burn generally. Do you have to refrigerate the insulin? Yes you have to refrigerate the insulin. It's a hormone and it can go bad so it needs to stay in the refrigerator until use. So you take it out, do our procedures here, put it back in the refrigerator until next use. How much insulin do I need? Well this is going to be specific to your own needs of course the doctors will likely prescribe you a long lasting insulin that you'll take as well as a short acting insulin. So you'll take your long lasting which will be a set amount of units based on your own metabolic needs and the short acting insulin will be based on a sliding scale depending on carbohydrates you've had throughout the day and what your blood sugar is at. So the higher blood sugar is the higher the dose of insulin is going to be in units. Of course it's very important not to overdo your insulin. That can lead to hypoglycemic shock or insulin shock is what they call it and hypoglycemia could very well end in coma and death if you do not pay attention. Can I reuse the same needle? It's against our advice to reuse the needle. It's for one thing if anything the needle is going to become dull. It's going to be harder to stick in. I mean you're going to have to think you already stuck it into the rubber spot here and that's going to dull it a little bit. Some people actually like to use two needles. One to aspirate, switch out the needle and then use it for your skin so that it goes in quicker and easier but also cleanliness. You don't want to reuse needles, get bacteria on there and that kind of thing. It's going to lead to infection if you continue to use the same needle. Do I have to wear gloves? I know I kind of covered this that if you're at home in your own setting it's just good to make sure you wash your hands. Maybe sanitize your hands if you have something but it's not necessary to wear gloves. It doesn't need to be sterile but do wash your hands. That would be good. Okay, here's my references from where I got my information. You see my book American Diabetic Association and Web of D of course. That's where everybody gets all their information. Well that's the end of my show, slide show and thank you for watching."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

So let's say this time you've given it to the right side. All right, let's give it on a different area on the left side.

And then either it retracts by itself or you let go once you're done with the dose. Afterwards, you have to record how much you've given the dose for. So let's say 200 units or less. And then afterwards, you have to remember which side of the stomach you've given it, left side or right side. And each time you give it, you have to alternate. So let's say this time you've given it to the right side. All right, let's give it on a different area on the left side.

I'm Mila, I have latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, which is a slow progressing form of type one diabetes. And I make videos about diabetes lifestyle, cooking, diabetes topics, stigma, all kinds of stuff about diabetes. If you like that kind of content and you're looking for someone like you and you're looking for a community of people who understand you and understand where you're coming from, you can join us here by hitting the thumbs up button and subscribing to this channel. Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye. Bye."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

I'm Mila, I have latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, which is a slow progressing form of type one diabetes. And I make videos about diabetes lifestyle, cooking, diabetes topics, stigma, all kinds of stuff about diabetes.

Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye.

So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye.

Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero.

I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye.

Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs. These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this.

These are really important as they help to keep your area sterile. I use one for my skin and one for my pen each time. Then we also have our little needle and this is a, I think this is a Novafine Plus needle. They're very, very small. I'll show it to you again when it's on the pen, but they are super tiny, not thick at all and they're also very short so it's really not going to hurt when you do your injection. So first things first, I'm going to get my skin prepped. So as a woman, I wear a bra. I don't know what you do if you're a dude, but I can tuck my shirt into my bra and then I can find the area that I want to inject in. I'm just going to choose this area because I like to rotate my injections. You should rotate your injections because you don't want to develop lipodystrophy in your skin. It makes your insulin not as effective because it won't absorb into your skin and then in turn your bloodstream enough. So you want to make sure to rotate your injections. There are many different sites you can do your injections. You can do the stomach area, which I like to do. You can do the sides of your arms. So like if you want to inject like here, just don't inject into muscle. So you know, this is a great area also. Your thighs are an okay area to also inject. Like I said, just don't inject into muscle because then your insulin will get used up way too fast and you'll end up with a very sharp low. So that's not what you want to do. So first things first, I'm going to roll up my sleeves because this is a really hard job. And I'm going to take one of my sterile alcohol pads and I'm going to open that up. And then I'm going to clean the area that I want to inject. So I'm going to squeeze just so I know what that area is. And then I'm done with that. Then I'm going to take my insulin pen. I'm going to uncap it. And then I have my other sterile alcohol swab. I'll uncap that or there's no cap on it, but I'll undo it. And then I'll clean the top of this. And I like to just clean it because you never know where you're going to put it or if you like lay it down on the counter, things like that. So I just always tend to clean the top of that. And then I have my pen needle, which is going to go on top of the pen. So your pen needles should always have a cover on them. If it doesn't, don't use it. Put it in a sharps bin and get a new one. So it should be covered and sealed. That's how you know that it is safe to use and hasn't been used before. And then you're going to pull the top off of that. Take your pen needle and assemble it onto the pen by sticking it on top and then giving it a twist. It should look like that. It should not fall off. But this part does pop off. So you have two caps on your pen needle. You have your first cap here. And then you have your second cap that protects it. And then there you go. You have your pen needle right there. If you don't see a droplet, so right now you can see kind of like this little droplet that's coming up, that's coming out of the pen. If you don't see that, you still do want to make sure that your pen is working. So what you can do is on your pen, there is a little dial right between zero and two. And you can use that to test out to make sure that your insulin is coming out of the pen needle without actually having to waste any units. It is the one unit mark, but I think it's totally fine to just use that one unit just to triple check that you're doing the right thing and that your units of insulin that you're taking are correct. So then you're going to turn it. It's backwards for me. So you're going to turn it to the number of units that you would take. Let me just do mine. So I take 30 units of Trisiba each day, once a day. So 30 units for the whole day. And then you're going to grab the skin that you cleaned and swabbed and then push the needle in. And I tend to go pretty fast. It's in there. You can kind of see. And then push down till that last click. So it'll click a bunch all the way down till it gets to zero. And then I just hold it there for a few seconds just to make sure that I got everything out of there. And then pull it out. You don't like want to wiggle it around and stuff. And then you're done. And that's it. So I'm gonna put my clothes back on. But that's pretty much all that you have to do. Then when you are finished with it, make sure that your pen got back to zero, which mine did because you want to make sure that you got all the insulin out and then carefully recap this pen. So I put both caps right back on. And then you untwist. And then you put the main cap back on. And then you stick your pen back in the refrigerator. If you do choose to leave your pen out at room temperature, that's okay. You just have to make sure to use it within 28 days. I recommend just sticking it back in the fridge just so you're safe and you can use it until the expiration date, which is typically printed on your insulin pen. But that's it. So that's it. That's how you take insulin. If this video is helpful, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. And I will see you guys in the next one. Take care. Bye.

Okay, I'm going to go grab my insulin pen, reset, and then I'm going to show you very quickly how to take insulin. As a kind of quick aside, the very first time that I'd gotten my insulin pen about four years ago, I cried when I first had to take insulin. I was really scared of it. I thought it was going to hurt. Taking insulin does not hurt. You may feel a little bit of a pinch. You may also feel a little bit of burning from the insulin, but that is totally normal. That is totally okay. And that is just something that happens when you take insulin. I'm going to show you where and how I take it in different areas of your body that you can take it as well as just what the overall process is like. I got to take it anyway today, so I might as well show you how I do it. So let me go grab it and then we're going to do a quick reset and I will show you how it's done. First up, I'm going to show you the tools that you need for taking your insulin. So I have my insulin pen. I don't know if it's upside down or not, but that's my insulin pen. I take an insulin called Trisiba, one of the insulins I take. It is a long acting insulin, so it lasts in my body for 24 hours and I take it one time every 24 hours. So it's one injection per day for this particular insulin. You may also be on a short acting insulin. There are lots of different labels of short acting insulin and that just means that it's going to last in your body for less time. I think they peak up to 30 minutes and yeah, it's a different type of insulin than what this is, but what I'm going to show you is kind of the same application. You just may have specified times from your doctor to take your insulin. So follow those directions, but this is the pen at least so you can see the tool. Then we also have our alcohol swabs.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: In this video, we'll be demonstrating the correct technique for injecting insulin using an insulin pen. But first, let's review the parts of an insulin pen. There is an insulin reservoir which contains all the insulin. There is a rubber stopper, which is where you will attach the insulin pen needle. There is a dosing window, which shows you how many units you've selected. And next to the dosing window is a dosing dial and an injection button. Now, let's gather up all the supplies we'll need. You'll need an alcohol wipe, your insulin pen, and a new pen needle. Remember, pen needles are designed for one-time use only, so every time you inject insulin, you should be using a fresh pen needle. First, remove the cap of your insulin pen. Then, take your alcohol wipe and swab the rubber stopper at the tip of the pen. Next, we're going to connect the pen needle. To do this, peel off the paper tab. Then, place the needle straight onto the pen and twist the pen needle on until it's secure. It doesn't need to be overly tight, just secure. The next step is to remove the two safety caps on the needle. Set aside the larger, clear cap because when you're all done, you're going to use it again to safely remove the needle. The smaller, inner shield should also be removed but can be thrown away. The next step is to perform a test shot to make sure there are no blockages to the flow of insulin and to remove potential air from the tip of the needle. To do this, turn the dosing dial on the pen until it says 2 in the dosing window. Next, hold the pen with the needle pointing straight up. If you see any air bubbles in the insulin reservoir, gently tap the pen until the bubbles move to the top. Next, press the dosing button. You should see a few drops appear at the tip of the needle, or a small stream of insulin can also shoot out. Once you've performed the test shot, you are ready to inject your dose. Turn the dosing dial until your prescribed dose appears in the window. You'll notice that only even numbers appear, but each line represents one unit. So, for example, if your dose was 5 units, the line you'd select is between the 4 and the 6. Once you've selected the right amount to give, clean the area where you are going to inject. Since insulin is injected into the fatty tissue, the options for injecting include the stomach, the outer part of your thighs, the back of your upper arm, and the upper buttock. When injecting insulin, it's important to remember that injection sites should be rotated, meaning pick a different site every time. Not rotating properly can result in changes to the skin, which can impact insulin absorption. How far away does your next injection site have to be? Well, one finger in between injection sites is sufficient to properly rotate. Insert the pen needle at a 90 degree angle. Once the needle is under the skin, press the dosing button down and count for at least 5-10 seconds with the button pressed down. Counting will help ensure that the entire dose has enough time to fully deliver. When you're done, it's time to remove the needle. Place the large, clear cap back on the insulin pen. Untwist the needle in the other direction until the needle comes completely off the pen. Then, properly dispose of the needle in a plastic, puncture-proof container with a lid. Finally, place the cap of the pen back on and safely store it. If you have any questions regarding your injection technique or the use of an insulin pen, please contact your primary care provider or diabetes specialist.

The next step is to perform a test shot to make sure there are no blockages to the flow of insulin and to remove potential air from the tip of the needle. To do this, turn the dosing dial on the pen until it says 2 in the dosing window. Next, hold the pen with the needle pointing straight up. If you see any air bubbles in the insulin reservoir, gently tap the pen until the bubbles move to the top. Next, press the dosing button. You should see a few drops appear at the tip of the needle, or a small stream of insulin can also shoot out. Once you've performed the test shot, you are ready to inject your dose. Turn the dosing dial until your prescribed dose appears in the window. You'll notice that only even numbers appear, but each line represents one unit. So, for example, if your dose was 5 units, the line you'd select is between the 4 and the 6. Once you've selected the right amount to give, clean the area where you are going to inject. Since insulin is injected into the fatty tissue, the options for injecting include the stomach, the outer part of your thighs, the back of your upper arm, and the upper buttock. When injecting insulin, it's important to remember that injection sites should be rotated, meaning pick a different site every time. Not rotating properly can result in changes to the skin, which can impact insulin absorption. How far away does your next injection site have to be? Well, one finger in between injection sites is sufficient to properly rotate. Insert the pen needle at a 90 degree angle. Once the needle is under the skin, press the dosing button down and count for at least 5-10 seconds with the button pressed down. Counting will help ensure that the entire dose has enough time to fully deliver. When you're done, it's time to remove the needle. Place the large, clear cap back on the insulin pen. Untwist the needle in the other direction until the needle comes completely off the pen. Then, properly dispose of the needle in a plastic, puncture-proof container with a lid. Finally, place the cap of the pen back on and safely store it. If you have any questions regarding your injection technique or the use of an insulin pen, please contact your primary care provider or diabetes specialist.

There is an insulin reservoir which contains all the insulin. There is a rubber stopper, which is where you will attach the insulin pen needle. There is a dosing window, which shows you how many units you've selected. And next to the dosing window is a dosing dial and an injection button. Now, let's gather up all the supplies we'll need. You'll need an alcohol wipe, your insulin pen, and a new pen needle. Remember, pen needles are designed for one-time use only, so every time you inject insulin, you should be using a fresh pen needle. First, remove the cap of your insulin pen. Then, take your alcohol wipe and swab the rubber stopper at the tip of the pen. Next, we're going to connect the pen needle. To do this, peel off the paper tab. Then, place the needle straight onto the pen and twist the pen needle on until it's secure. It doesn't need to be overly tight, just secure.
