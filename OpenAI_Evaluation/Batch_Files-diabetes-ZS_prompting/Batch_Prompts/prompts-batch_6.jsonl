Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: In this video, we'll be demonstrating the correct technique for injecting insulin using an insulin pen. But first, let's review the parts of an insulin pen. There is an insulin reservoir which contains all the insulin. There is a rubber stopper, which is where you will attach the insulin pen needle. There is a dosing window, which shows you how many units you've selected. And next to the dosing window is a dosing dial and an injection button. Now, let's gather up all the supplies we'll need. You'll need an alcohol wipe, your insulin pen, and a new pen needle. Remember, pen needles are designed for one-time use only, so every time you inject insulin, you should be using a fresh pen needle. First, remove the cap of your insulin pen. Then, take your alcohol wipe and swab the rubber stopper at the tip of the pen. Next, we're going to connect the pen needle. To do this, peel off the paper tab. Then, place the needle straight onto the pen and twist the pen needle on until it's secure. It doesn't need to be overly tight, just secure. The next step is to remove the two safety caps on the needle. Set aside the larger, clear cap because when you're all done, you're going to use it again to safely remove the needle. The smaller, inner shield should also be removed but can be thrown away. The next step is to perform a test shot to make sure there are no blockages to the flow of insulin and to remove potential air from the tip of the needle. To do this, turn the dosing dial on the pen until it says 2 in the dosing window. Next, hold the pen with the needle pointing straight up. If you see any air bubbles in the insulin reservoir, gently tap the pen until the bubbles move to the top. Next, press the dosing button. You should see a few drops appear at the tip of the needle, or a small stream of insulin can also shoot out. Once you've performed the test shot, you are ready to inject your dose. Turn the dosing dial until your prescribed dose appears in the window. You'll notice that only even numbers appear, but each line represents one unit. So, for example, if your dose was 5 units, the line you'd select is between the 4 and the 6. Once you've selected the right amount to give, clean the area where you are going to inject. Since insulin is injected into the fatty tissue, the options for injecting include the stomach, the outer part of your thighs, the back of your upper arm, and the upper buttock. When injecting insulin, it's important to remember that injection sites should be rotated, meaning pick a different site every time. Not rotating properly can result in changes to the skin, which can impact insulin absorption. How far away does your next injection site have to be? Well, one finger in between injection sites is sufficient to properly rotate. Insert the pen needle at a 90 degree angle. Once the needle is under the skin, press the dosing button down and count for at least 5-10 seconds with the button pressed down. Counting will help ensure that the entire dose has enough time to fully deliver. When you're done, it's time to remove the needle. Place the large, clear cap back on the insulin pen. Untwist the needle in the other direction until the needle comes completely off the pen. Then, properly dispose of the needle in a plastic, puncture-proof container with a lid. Finally, place the cap of the pen back on and safely store it. If you have any questions regarding your injection technique or the use of an insulin pen, please contact your primary care provider or diabetes specialist.

There is a dosing window, which shows you how many units you've selected. And next to the dosing window is a dosing dial and an injection button. Now, let's gather up all the supplies we'll need. You'll need an alcohol wipe, your insulin pen, and a new pen needle. Remember, pen needles are designed for one-time use only, so every time you inject insulin, you should be using a fresh pen needle. First, remove the cap of your insulin pen. Then, take your alcohol wipe and swab the rubber stopper at the tip of the pen. Next, we're going to connect the pen needle. To do this, peel off the paper tab. Then, place the needle straight onto the pen and twist the pen needle on until it's secure. It doesn't need to be overly tight, just secure. The next step is to remove the two safety caps on the needle. Set aside the larger, clear cap because when you're all done, you're going to use it again to safely remove the needle. The smaller, inner shield should also be removed but can be thrown away. The next step is to perform a test shot to make sure there are no blockages to the flow of insulin and to remove potential air from the tip of the needle. To do this, turn the dosing dial on the pen until it says 2 in the dosing window. Next, hold the pen with the needle pointing straight up. If you see any air bubbles in the insulin reservoir, gently tap the pen until the bubbles move to the top. Next, press the dosing button. You should see a few drops appear at the tip of the needle, or a small stream of insulin can also shoot out. Once you've performed the test shot, you are ready to inject your dose. Turn the dosing dial until your prescribed dose appears in the window. You'll notice that only even numbers appear, but each line represents one unit. So, for example, if your dose was 5 units, the line you'd select is between the 4 and the 6. Once you've selected the right amount to give, clean the area where you are going to inject. Since insulin is injected into the fatty tissue, the options for injecting include the stomach, the outer part of your thighs, the back of your upper arm, and the upper buttock. When injecting insulin, it's important to remember that injection sites should be rotated, meaning pick a different site every time. Not rotating properly can result in changes to the skin, which can impact insulin absorption. How far away does your next injection site have to be? Well, one finger in between injection sites is sufficient to properly rotate. Insert the pen needle at a 90 degree angle. Once the needle is under the skin, press the dosing button down and count for at least 5-10 seconds with the button pressed down. Counting will help ensure that the entire dose has enough time to fully deliver. When you're done, it's time to remove the needle. Place the large, clear cap back on the insulin pen. Untwist the needle in the other direction until the needle comes completely off the pen. Then, properly dispose of the needle in a plastic, puncture-proof container with a lid. Finally, place the cap of the pen back on and safely store it. If you have any questions regarding your injection technique or the use of an insulin pen, please contact your primary care provider or diabetes specialist.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: This video will walk you through the steps necessary to administer insulin with your disposable insulin pen. You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button. Once the cap is removed, you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window. In addition to a prescription for your insulin pen, you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor. You will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen. Now, we will review the steps that you should complete for each insulin injection. We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need. In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button. Once the cap is removed, you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window. In addition to a prescription for your insulin pen, you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor. You will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen. Now, we will review the steps that you should complete for each insulin injection. We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need. In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose.

If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need. In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button. Once the cap is removed, you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window. In addition to a prescription for your insulin pen, you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor. You will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen. Now, we will review the steps that you should complete for each insulin injection. We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again.

In addition to a prescription for your insulin pen, you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor. You will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen. Now, we will review the steps that you should complete for each insulin injection. We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need. In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: This video will walk you through the steps necessary to administer insulin with your disposable insulin pen. You may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here. Insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed. The information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens. First, let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen. It is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight. When you fill your prescription at the pharmacy, you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens. Take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use. Do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them. Unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box. It is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze. Once it is opened, an insulin pen can be used for 10, 14, 28, or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains. This chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature. You should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended, whichever comes first. If you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded, please check the instructions that come with your pen. Be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using. It is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available. Now that you know how to store your insulin, let's review the parts of your insulin pen. There's the cap, the label, the dose adjustment dial, and the injection button. Once the cap is removed, you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window. In addition to a prescription for your insulin pen, you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor. You will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen. Now, we will review the steps that you should complete for each insulin injection. We will go through six main steps. The first step is getting everything ready. Obtain everything that you will need for the injection. You will need your insulin pen, a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol, a new pen needle, and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection. Next, look at your insulin pen. Check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you. Also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection. Remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside. You will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin. It is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject. For most types of insulin, such as those shown here, the insulin should be clear and not discolored. There are some insulins, such as the mixed insulins, that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance. Make sure you talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist or check with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like. No matter what type of insulin you are using, you should not see any solid particles in your insulin. Cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use. To mix a cloudy insulin, put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms 10 times. Then turn the pen up and down 10 times. Check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps. Remember, this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin. The second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen. Take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point. Take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal. Attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen. Then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore. Remove the outer cap and keep it. You will need it again after you are done giving your injection. Remove the inner cap and throw it away. The third step is priming your insulin pen. Priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection. To do this, turn your dose adjustment dial to 2 units. Now turn your insulin pen so that the needle is facing upward. Tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen. While keeping the pen facing upward, push the injection button all of the way in. You should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button. If you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle, re-dial another 2 units and push the injection button in all the way again. If no insulin comes out after 3 tries, attach a new needle and repeat this step. The fourth step is selecting your dose. Turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need. In this example, we will be injecting 10 units of insulin. If you accidentally turn the dial too far, simply turn it back to the dose that you need. The fifth step is injecting your insulin. Decide where you would like to make your injection. You can choose from your upper arm, abdomen, hip, or upper thigh. You can use this same general area for each injection, but you want to stay at least 1 inch away from your last injection site, any scars, and your belly button. Once you have selected your injection site, wipe the area with an alcohol swab. Make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn. Gently pinch the area of skin, unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions, and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator. To deliver your dose, push the injection button in the whole way. Keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10. Insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button. Now, remove the needle from your skin. If you bleed at the site of the injection, then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze. Do not rub the area. The sixth step is disposing of the needle. You should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection. Pen needles cannot be reused, and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached. Put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle. Now, unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion. The needle will come off with the cap. You should dispose of your needle in a sharps container, like the one pictured here. You can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy. You can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle. Label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle. When the container is full, tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash. Now, put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection. When you get to the end of the insulin reservoir, there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose. If you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require, do not force it. Your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen. For example, if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen, you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units. When this occurs, you have two options. The first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose. Your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need. Now, let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection. First, get everything ready. Obtain everything you need to make your injection. Wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin, then gently mix it. Second, attach the insulin pen needle to the pen. Third, prime your pen. Fourth, select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject. Fifth, inject your insulin. Don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of 10 before removing the needle. And lastly, dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container. By following these steps with each injection, you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen. ."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

First you need to gather your supplies, which would be the insulin pen itself, an alcohol swab, and the pen needle. Then you want to wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol sanitation solution. Rub your hands together until it's dry. Start by removing the cap to the pen. At this point, if you have cloudy insulin, which would include NPH insulin or a mixture thereof, you want to mix it. You mix it with your palms, like rolling it together, or you can go gently back and forth. You don't want to rigorously shake it. If you have clear insulin that does not contain NPH, then you don't have to mix. You can skip that part altogether. Use your alcohol wipe to wipe the rubber membrane on the end of the pen. And then remove the protective tab on the pen needle. Push the needle into the end of the pen and turn it clockwise to tighten it. Next you want to do what we call a safety check to make sure there's no air in the system. You'll dial the dose indicator to two units, remove the outer needle cap, and save that for later. The inner needle cap you can remove and throw away. So you've dialed to two units. You're going to push on the injector button and watch the end of the needle to make sure that you see some insulin come out. It might be a stream or it might be just drops of insulin. As long as you see liquid there, you know that there's no air in the system. Next you're going to dial the dose that's been prescribed for you. For example, if five units is my dose, I'll dial to the mark right between the four and the six. And I'm ready to give it. The preferred site for insulin administration is the abdomen. The abdomen is from your rib cage to your hips and as far laterally as you can comfortably reach. You want to rotate sites so that you're not returning to the same couple places again and again. You should be about two finger widths away from your belly button. So first expose the injection site. Hold your pen like a writing pen or a dart and then you want to go straight into the skin. You can use the other hand if you wish or the same hand to push on the injector button. And just you'll feel it and see it rotate as it's injected. And then once you've injected the entire solution, hold it for 10 seconds or count to 10 before removing the needle. When you're done, you want to dispose of that pen needle in a puncture proof container. A coffee can, a detergent bottle, a prescription bottle, something that's puncture proof and has a lid. You put the protective cap on and turn counterclockwise to remove the needle. Lastly you want to make sure the pen cap gets back on to protect the insulin from the light."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

First you need to gather your supplies, which would be the insulin pen itself, an alcohol swab, and the pen needle. Then you want to wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol sanitation solution. Rub your hands together until it's dry. Start by removing the cap to the pen. At this point, if you have cloudy insulin, which would include NPH insulin or a mixture thereof, you want to mix it. You mix it with your palms, like rolling it together, or you can go gently back and forth. You don't want to rigorously shake it. If you have clear insulin that does not contain NPH, then you don't have to mix. You can skip that part altogether. Use your alcohol wipe to wipe the rubber membrane on the end of the pen. And then remove the protective tab on the pen needle. Push the needle into the end of the pen and turn it clockwise to tighten it. Next you want to do what we call a safety check to make sure there's no air in the system. You'll dial the dose indicator to two units, remove the outer needle cap, and save that for later. The inner needle cap you can remove and throw away. So you've dialed to two units. You're going to push on the injector button and watch the end of the needle to make sure that you see some insulin come out. It might be a stream or it might be just drops of insulin. As long as you see liquid there, you know that there's no air in the system. Next you're going to dial the dose that's been prescribed for you. For example, if five units is my dose, I'll dial to the mark right between the four and the six. And I'm ready to give it. The preferred site for insulin administration is the abdomen. The abdomen is from your rib cage to your hips and as far laterally as you can comfortably reach. You want to rotate sites so that you're not returning to the same couple places again and again. You should be about two finger widths away from your belly button. So first expose the injection site. Hold your pen like a writing pen or a dart and then you want to go straight into the skin. You can use the other hand if you wish or the same hand to push on the injector button. And just you'll feel it and see it rotate as it's injected. And then once you've injected the entire solution, hold it for 10 seconds or count to 10 before removing the needle. When you're done, you want to dispose of that pen needle in a puncture proof container. A coffee can, a detergent bottle, a prescription bottle, something that's puncture proof and has a lid. You put the protective cap on and turn counterclockwise to remove the needle. Lastly you want to make sure the pen cap gets back on to protect the insulin from the light."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}
