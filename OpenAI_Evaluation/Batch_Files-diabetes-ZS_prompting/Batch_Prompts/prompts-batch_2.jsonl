It's important to always wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds prior to giving an insulin injection. Insulin helps take the glucose in your blood and move it into your cells to provide energy. All patients with type 1 diabetes and many patients with type 2 diabetes need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Many patients need two different types of insulin. Basil or long-acting insulin is insulin given once or twice daily to control your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Basil insulin should be taken every day regardless of eating. Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. If you use an insulin vial, always clean the top of the vial with a new alcohol swab before each injection. Use a new syringe for each injection. Each syringe has two caps, an orange cap that protects the needle and a white cap to cover the syringe plunger. Both of these caps will be removed prior to using the syringe. To draw up your insulin dose, first draw air into the syringe equal to your dose of insulin. Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle. Push the air into the vial. Flip the vial over to withdraw insulin. Pull back on the plunger until you have the correct amount of insulin in your syringe. Be sure to measure at the top of the black plunger. If you have any air bubbles, push them back into the vial and pull out more insulin until your dose is correct. Air bubbles will not hurt you, but your dose will not be accurate. If using a syringe, hold the syringe like a dart and gently pinch your skin where you're going to inject. Inject at a 90-degree angle. Inject the insulin and count to 10 before removing the syringe. Throw the syringe directly into your sharps container. Never recap a syringe."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

If you have any air bubbles, push them back into the vial and pull out more insulin until your dose is correct. Air bubbles will not hurt you, but your dose will not be accurate.

It's important to always wash your hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds prior to giving an insulin injection. Insulin helps take the glucose in your blood and move it into your cells to provide energy. All patients with type 1 diabetes and many patients with type 2 diabetes need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Many patients need two different types of insulin. Basil or long-acting insulin is insulin given once or twice daily to control your blood sugar overnight and between meals. Basil insulin should be taken every day regardless of eating. Bowlus or mealtime insulin is given with the first bite of a meal and prevents a large spike in your blood sugar after eating. Bowlus insulin should be skipped if you skip a meal. Insulin should be given in the abdomen, back of the arm, upper leg, or top of the bottom. Injections should be rotated to different locations every time. Even if you always inject in your stomach, move your injection site a few inches each time but always stay two inches away from your belly button. Rotating the site of injection will help reduce the risk of scar tissue development or infection. Gather your supplies. If you use an insulin pen, you will need your pen, a pen needle, and two alcohol wipes. If you use an insulin vial, you will need the vial, a syringe, and two alcohol wipes. You should use a new pen needle or syringe for every injection. Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Make sure to let the alcohol dry before injecting. If you use an insulin vial, always clean the top of the vial with a new alcohol swab before each injection. Use a new syringe for each injection. Each syringe has two caps, an orange cap that protects the needle and a white cap to cover the syringe plunger. Both of these caps will be removed prior to using the syringe. To draw up your insulin dose, first draw air into the syringe equal to your dose of insulin. Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle. Push the air into the vial. Flip the vial over to withdraw insulin. Pull back on the plunger until you have the correct amount of insulin in your syringe. Be sure to measure at the top of the black plunger. If you have any air bubbles, push them back into the vial and pull out more insulin until your dose is correct. Air bubbles will not hurt you, but your dose will not be accurate. If using a syringe, hold the syringe like a dart and gently pinch your skin where you're going to inject. Inject at a 90-degree angle. Inject the insulin and count to 10 before removing the syringe. Throw the syringe directly into your sharps container. Never recap a syringe."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

There's a little tip there as well so it's doubly packaged. There's an extremely tiny needle. It's a 26 gauge needle. So small you can barely see it and as you might expect, virtually painless because it's so small. First of all, we're going to test the system to make sure that it's dispensing insulin. You can see here there's a little place where you count the units. We're going to load this up with 10 units. 10 units is a common starting dose. Each unit is a click. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And there it is, 10 units. We're now going to fire it. I'm going to squirt it into the garbage and you should be able to see the little jet of insulin. So we squirt it and we count to five after we've stopped and you can see the last drop is falling off. Now I don't have diabetes so I'm not going to give myself a shot but I'm going to pretend to give myself a shot. I'm going to put it up to 10 units and then I'm going to dial it back to zero just because I don't want to give myself any insulin. You of course are going to give yourself the required dose. Most people start on 10 units a day. So imagine I put the 10 units on. I'm taking it off. I then lift up my shirt and I stick it into my skin and then I inject and I count to five. One, two, three, four, five. Then I take it out and you finish the ejection. Now the manufacturers always tell you to replace the needle tip every time. I don't believe in that. That's wasted. You can use it four or five times. So if this were my insulin pen I would make sure I didn't touch the end of it.

The NPH insulin bottle. It should look cloudy. If there are any clumps of residue, throw it out. You want 100 syringe, alcohol swabs and a glass jar for the used syringe. Step 2. Preparing your insulin. Wipe the top of the bottles with an alcohol swab. Roll the NPH insulin between your hands. If your prescribed amount of NPH insulin is 5ml and you have a new bottle, inject 5ml of air into the vial. If your prescribed amount of regular NPH insulin is 5ml, also inject 5ml of air into the regular vial. Then, keeping the needle inside the regular bottle, turn it upside down. Pull the plunger back slowly for 5ml of NPH insulin. Make sure the top of the black rubber stopper is even with your required dose. Check for air bubbles. If there are air bubbles, lightly flick the syringe, pushing the bubble to the top of the syringe and then pushing it into the top of the bottle. Repeat these steps with the NPH insulin. Turn it upside down. Slowly pull the plunger back for 5ml. Good job. Step 3. Injection sites. Rotate amongst these sites. Back of the arm, buttocks, abdomen, thigh and back of hip. Clean your site with an alcohol swab and let it air dry. Step 4. Inject. Pinch a section of skin and inject at an angle of 90 degrees. Inject the insulin slowly and remove quickly. Do not recap the needle. Step 5. Flip the safety lock on the syringe and dispose of the needle in the sharps container. Use gentle pressure just to make sure there is no bleeding.

Preparing your insulin. Wipe the top of the bottles with an alcohol swab. Roll the NPH insulin between your hands. If your prescribed amount of NPH insulin is 5ml and you have a new bottle, inject 5ml of air into the vial. If your prescribed amount of regular NPH insulin is 5ml, also inject 5ml of air into the regular vial. Then, keeping the needle inside the regular bottle, turn it upside down. Pull the plunger back slowly for 5ml of NPH insulin. Make sure the top of the black rubber stopper is even with your required dose. Check for air bubbles. If there are air bubbles, lightly flick the syringe, pushing the bubble to the top of the syringe and then pushing it into the top of the bottle. Repeat these steps with the NPH insulin. Turn it upside down. Slowly pull the plunger back for 5ml. Good job. Step 3. Injection sites. Rotate amongst these sites. Back of the arm, buttocks, abdomen, thigh and back of hip. Clean your site with an alcohol swab and let it air dry. Step 4. Inject. Pinch a section of skin and inject at an angle of 90 degrees. Inject the insulin slowly and remove quickly. Do not recap the needle. Step 5. Flip the safety lock on the syringe and dispose of the needle in the sharps container. Use gentle pressure just to make sure there is no bleeding. Apply band aid if needed. And we are done."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: This video will teach you how to inject your insulin using a syringe. Please watch the entire video before injecting your insulin. Your healthcare provider may recommend that you inject insulin using a syringe to help you control your blood sugar level. Injecting insulin with a syringe involves choosing an injection site, preparing the syringe and insulin, and then injecting the insulin into your body. Your healthcare provider will tell you what type of insulin you need, as well as when and how much you need to inject. You will need alcohol wipes, your bottle of insulin, a new syringe for each injection, and a sharps disposal container to throw away the used syringes. A disposable syringe has the following parts, a barrel, a plunger, a needle cap, and a needle. Selecting the Injection Site. Before injecting your insulin, select the injection site on your body. The areas for insulin injection include the abdomen or belly, upper arms, the thighs, and the buttocks. When selecting the injection site, be sure you use a different spot each time you give yourself an injection. Leave at least one inch away from the last injection spot. Inject your insulin at least two inches from your belly button, and choose a spot one inch or farther away from any scar or mole. Preparing the Syringe and Insulin. Step one, wash your hands with soap and water, and then dry them. Step two, if your insulin needs to be mixed, gently roll the bottle between your hands. Do not shake the bottle because it may cause bubbles to form in your insulin. Before injecting yourself, check the insulin in the bottle to make sure it is the type of insulin your doctor prescribed for you, not past the expiration date, and the insulin is free of clumps. Step three, remove the cap from your insulin bottle. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber stopper on the top of the bottle. Step four, remove the syringe from its package. Be sure to use a new syringe each time you inject insulin. Step five, remove the needle cap from the syringe. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface, and do not use the syringe if the needle is bent. Some syringes have a cap over the plunger that you may need to remove as well. Step six, pull back the plunger to draw in an amount of air that is equal to your insulin dose. Step seven, hold your insulin bottle securely on a flat surface. Push the needle through the rubber on the top of the bottle. Push the plunger to inject the air into the insulin bottle. Leave the needle in the bottle. This helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw insulin into the syringe. Step eight, with the needle still in the bottle, turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Step nine, pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with just a little more than the insulin dose you need. If you see air bubbles, tap the barrel of the syringe with your finger to make them rise to the top. Slowly push in the plunger just enough to push out the air and extra insulin. Step ten, carefully check to make sure the amount of insulin in the syringe matches your insulin dose. Pull the needle out of the bottle and carefully lay the syringe on a flat, clean surface. Make sure the needle does not touch anything. Cleaning the Insulin Step one, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Use a circular motion to clean a spot about two inches wide. Step two, pinch a two-inch fold of skin in the cleaned injection spot. Step three, hold the syringe like a pencil and quickly insert the needle straight into your skin at a 90 degree angle. Make sure the whole needle enters your skin. Step four, push the plunger all the way down to inject the insulin into the fat tissue beneath your skin. Slowly count to five before removing the needle to make sure you have injected all of the insulin. Step five, pull the needle straight out to remove it. Step six, throw away the syringe into your sharps disposal container. Never throw your syringes or needles directly into the trash. Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about injecting your insulin or if your blood sugar level stays above or below your target range."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Inject your insulin at least two inches from your belly button, and choose a spot one inch or farther away from any scar or mole. Preparing the Syringe and Insulin. Step one, wash your hands with soap and water, and then dry them. Step two, if your insulin needs to be mixed, gently roll the bottle between your hands. Do not shake the bottle because it may cause bubbles to form in your insulin. Before injecting yourself, check the insulin in the bottle to make sure it is the type of insulin your doctor prescribed for you, not past the expiration date, and the insulin is free of clumps. Step three, remove the cap from your insulin bottle. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber stopper on the top of the bottle. Step four, remove the syringe from its package. Be sure to use a new syringe each time you inject insulin. Step five, remove the needle cap from the syringe. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface, and do not use the syringe if the needle is bent. Some syringes have a cap over the plunger that you may need to remove as well. Step six, pull back the plunger to draw in an amount of air that is equal to your insulin dose. Step seven, hold your insulin bottle securely on a flat surface. Push the needle through the rubber on the top of the bottle. Push the plunger to inject the air into the insulin bottle. Leave the needle in the bottle. This helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw insulin into the syringe. Step eight, with the needle still in the bottle, turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Step nine, pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with just a little more than the insulin dose you need. If you see air bubbles, tap the barrel of the syringe with your finger to make them rise to the top. Slowly push in the plunger just enough to push out the air and extra insulin. Step ten, carefully check to make sure the amount of insulin in the syringe matches your insulin dose. Pull the needle out of the bottle and carefully lay the syringe on a flat, clean surface. Make sure the needle does not touch anything. Cleaning the Insulin Step one, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Use a circular motion to clean a spot about two inches wide. Step two, pinch a two-inch fold of skin in the cleaned injection spot. Step three, hold the syringe like a pencil and quickly insert the needle straight into your skin at a 90 degree angle. Make sure the whole needle enters your skin. Step four, push the plunger all the way down to inject the insulin into the fat tissue beneath your skin. Slowly count to five before removing the needle to make sure you have injected all of the insulin. Step five, pull the needle straight out to remove it. Step six, throw away the syringe into your sharps disposal container. Never throw your syringes or needles directly into the trash. Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about injecting your insulin or if your blood sugar level stays above or below your target range."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Your healthcare provider may recommend that you inject insulin using a syringe to help you control your blood sugar level. Injecting insulin with a syringe involves choosing an injection site, preparing the syringe and insulin, and then injecting the insulin into your body. Your healthcare provider will tell you what type of insulin you need, as well as when and how much you need to inject. You will need alcohol wipes, your bottle of insulin, a new syringe for each injection, and a sharps disposal container to throw away the used syringes. A disposable syringe has the following parts, a barrel, a plunger, a needle cap, and a needle. Selecting the Injection Site. Before injecting your insulin, select the injection site on your body. The areas for insulin injection include the abdomen or belly, upper arms, the thighs, and the buttocks. When selecting the injection site, be sure you use a different spot each time you give yourself an injection. Leave at least one inch away from the last injection spot. Inject your insulin at least two inches from your belly button, and choose a spot one inch or farther away from any scar or mole. Preparing the Syringe and Insulin. Step one, wash your hands with soap and water, and then dry them. Step two, if your insulin needs to be mixed, gently roll the bottle between your hands. Do not shake the bottle because it may cause bubbles to form in your insulin. Before injecting yourself, check the insulin in the bottle to make sure it is the type of insulin your doctor prescribed for you, not past the expiration date, and the insulin is free of clumps. Step three, remove the cap from your insulin bottle. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the rubber stopper on the top of the bottle. Step four, remove the syringe from its package. Be sure to use a new syringe each time you inject insulin. Step five, remove the needle cap from the syringe. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface, and do not use the syringe if the needle is bent. Some syringes have a cap over the plunger that you may need to remove as well. Step six, pull back the plunger to draw in an amount of air that is equal to your insulin dose. Step seven, hold your insulin bottle securely on a flat surface. Push the needle through the rubber on the top of the bottle. Push the plunger to inject the air into the insulin bottle. Leave the needle in the bottle. This helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw insulin into the syringe. Step eight, with the needle still in the bottle, turn the bottle and syringe upside down. Step nine, pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with just a little more than the insulin dose you need. If you see air bubbles, tap the barrel of the syringe with your finger to make them rise to the top. Slowly push in the plunger just enough to push out the air and extra insulin. Step ten, carefully check to make sure the amount of insulin in the syringe matches your insulin dose. Pull the needle out of the bottle and carefully lay the syringe on a flat, clean surface. Make sure the needle does not touch anything. Cleaning the Insulin Step one, clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Use a circular motion to clean a spot about two inches wide. Step two, pinch a two-inch fold of skin in the cleaned injection spot. Step three, hold the syringe like a pencil and quickly insert the needle straight into your skin at a 90 degree angle. Make sure the whole needle enters your skin. Step four, push the plunger all the way down to inject the insulin into the fat tissue beneath your skin. Slowly count to five before removing the needle to make sure you have injected all of the insulin. Step five, pull the needle straight out to remove it. Step six, throw away the syringe into your sharps disposal container. Never throw your syringes or needles directly into the trash.

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, I'm Dr. Emily Walker, a VA pharmacist, and I would like to discuss with you the proper way to give yourself insulin using an insulin pen. There are many different types of insulin pens available from the VA. In this video, I will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the Flex Pen. Other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include Flex Touch, Solastar, or Quick Pen. What is important for you to know is that the correct technique that I will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. Remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your VA provider. Let's get started. When you are preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. These supplies include your insulin Flex Pen or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. If you do not have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write USED NEEDLES on the side with a permanent marker. Before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. When your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. Next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. Do not use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin. By inspecting the insulin pen, you will also be double checking that you have the correct type of insulin. As I mentioned already, for our example today, I am using the Novolog Flex Pen, which has been pre-filled with insulin aspart. After inspecting the insulin pen, put it down and open an alcohol swab. Wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. Allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. Do not blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. Next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. Grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. Make sure you do not over tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. Next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. You will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. Remove the inner plastic needle cap. Both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. It is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. Never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. Next we will complete an air shot with the insulin pen, which should be done before each injection. An air shot is sometimes called priming. Doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. Turn the dial up to two units. Hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. Next, press the push button all the way in. The dial should return to zero. You should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. If the drop does not appear, repeat the process. This can be repeated up to six times. If it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. If that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. Next, select your insulin dose. Check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. The pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. The dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. For example, if you are prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. Be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. You will hear a click for each unit you dial. It is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose. Please note towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. Next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. If you just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. Remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. Insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks on the high hip upper outer area, thigh or upper arm, that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. The needle you are using is thin and may bend. You may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. It is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. If you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs or buttocks. Avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened or has lumps. Avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard. In addition, stay 1 to 2 inches away from your belly button, scars or skin with open wounds. If you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. For instance, give your basal or long-acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid-acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. Insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. Again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a 1 to 2 inch portion of skin in fact. Once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. Keep it pressed for a full 6 seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. Now you can remove the insulin pen. A small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. This is normal and can be expected. If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, I'm Dr. Emily Walker, a VA pharmacist, and I would like to discuss with you the proper way to give yourself insulin using an insulin pen. There are many different types of insulin pens available from the VA. In this video, I will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the Flex Pen. Other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include Flex Touch, Solastar, or Quick Pen. What is important for you to know is that the correct technique that I will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. Remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your VA provider. Let's get started. When you are preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. These supplies include your insulin Flex Pen or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. If you do not have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write USED NEEDLES on the side with a permanent marker. Before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. When your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. Next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. Do not use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin. By inspecting the insulin pen, you will also be double checking that you have the correct type of insulin. As I mentioned already, for our example today, I am using the Novolog Flex Pen, which has been pre-filled with insulin aspart. After inspecting the insulin pen, put it down and open an alcohol swab. Wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. Allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. Do not blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. Next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. Grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. Make sure you do not over tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. Next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. You will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. Remove the inner plastic needle cap. Both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. It is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. Never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. Next we will complete an air shot with the insulin pen, which should be done before each injection. An air shot is sometimes called priming. Doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. Turn the dial up to two units. Hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. Next, press the push button all the way in. The dial should return to zero. You should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. If the drop does not appear, repeat the process. This can be repeated up to six times. If it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. If that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. Next, select your insulin dose. Check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. The pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. The dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. For example, if you are prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. Be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. You will hear a click for each unit you dial. It is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose. Please note towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. Next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. If you just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. Remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. Insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks on the high hip upper outer area, thigh or upper arm, that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. The needle you are using is thin and may bend. You may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. It is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. If you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs or buttocks. Avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened or has lumps. Avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard. In addition, stay 1 to 2 inches away from your belly button, scars or skin with open wounds. If you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. For instance, give your basal or long-acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid-acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. Insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. Again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a 1 to 2 inch portion of skin in fact. Once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. Keep it pressed for a full 6 seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. Now you can remove the insulin pen. A small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. This is normal and can be expected. If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. Allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. Do not blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. Next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. Grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. Make sure you do not over tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. Next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. You will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. Remove the inner plastic needle cap. Both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. It is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. Never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. Next we will complete an air shot with the insulin pen, which should be done before each injection. An air shot is sometimes called priming. Doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. Turn the dial up to two units. Hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. Next, press the push button all the way in. The dial should return to zero. You should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. If the drop does not appear, repeat the process. This can be repeated up to six times. If it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. If that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. Next, select your insulin dose. Check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. The pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. The dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. For example, if you are prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. Be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. You will hear a click for each unit you dial. It is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose. Please note towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. Next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. If you just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. Remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. Insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks on the high hip upper outer area, thigh or upper arm, that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. The needle you are using is thin and may bend. You may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. It is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. If you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs or buttocks. Avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened or has lumps. Avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard. In addition, stay 1 to 2 inches away from your belly button, scars or skin with open wounds. If you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. For instance, give your basal or long-acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid-acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. Insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. Again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a 1 to 2 inch portion of skin in fact. Once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. Keep it pressed for a full 6 seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. Now you can remove the insulin pen. A small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. This is normal and can be expected. If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

There are many different types of insulin pens available from the VA. In this video, I will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the Flex Pen. Other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include Flex Touch, Solastar, or Quick Pen. What is important for you to know is that the correct technique that I will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. Remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your VA provider. Let's get started. When you are preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. These supplies include your insulin Flex Pen or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. If you do not have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write USED NEEDLES on the side with a permanent marker. Before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. When your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. Next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. Do not use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin.

Please note towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. Next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. If you just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. Remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. Insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks on the high hip upper outer area, thigh or upper arm, that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. The needle you are using is thin and may bend. You may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. It is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. If you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs or buttocks. Avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened or has lumps. Avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard. In addition, stay 1 to 2 inches away from your belly button, scars or skin with open wounds. If you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. For instance, give your basal or long-acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid-acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. Insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. Again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a 1 to 2 inch portion of skin in fact. Once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. Keep it pressed for a full 6 seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. Now you can remove the insulin pen. A small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. This is normal and can be expected. If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Then, explain your choice\n\nTranscript: Hi, I'm Dr. Emily Walker, a VA pharmacist, and I would like to discuss with you the proper way to give yourself insulin using an insulin pen. There are many different types of insulin pens available from the VA. In this video, I will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the Flex Pen. Other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include Flex Touch, Solastar, or Quick Pen. What is important for you to know is that the correct technique that I will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. Remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your VA provider. Let's get started. When you are preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. These supplies include your insulin Flex Pen or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. If you do not have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write USED NEEDLES on the side with a permanent marker. Before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. When your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. Next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. Do not use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin. By inspecting the insulin pen, you will also be double checking that you have the correct type of insulin. As I mentioned already, for our example today, I am using the Novolog Flex Pen, which has been pre-filled with insulin aspart. After inspecting the insulin pen, put it down and open an alcohol swab. Wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. Allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. Do not blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. Next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. Grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. Make sure you do not over tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. Next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. You will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. Remove the inner plastic needle cap. Both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. It is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. Never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. Next we will complete an air shot with the insulin pen, which should be done before each injection. An air shot is sometimes called priming. Doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. Turn the dial up to two units. Hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. Next, press the push button all the way in. The dial should return to zero. You should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. If the drop does not appear, repeat the process. This can be repeated up to six times. If it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. If that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. Next, select your insulin dose. Check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. The pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. The dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. For example, if you are prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. Be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. You will hear a click for each unit you dial. It is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose.

If a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. Once the injection is completed, do not recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. Remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. Discard the pen needle into the sharps container. Place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. Your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. It is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. Never freeze insulin. When the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. At that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. The pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. You have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. Good job! I thank you for your service to our country and I'm honored to be of service to you this day."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}

Dr. David has prescribed you a once daily insulin injection to help your glucose control improve. There are many different types of insulin and these are available in valves, cartridges and insulin pans. The insulin that is prescribed for you is a background insulin that comes in insulin pan device. The insulin pans are pre-filled with insulin and you can use it multiple times until the pan is empty. There are many different types of insulin pan devices each containing different types of insulin. These are coded with different colors and it is important for you to know the name of the insulin you are on, recognize the pan device and how much insulin you are supposed to give yourself. Now I'm going to show you how to use this insulin pan, demonstrate the injection technique followed by how best to care for and store the pan. Thank you for your explanation. I'm ready to start. First wash your hands before handling the insulin pan. Each time you are giving an insulin dose, you will need to prepare two alcohol swabs. Insulin pan needle. Insulin pan needles come in different lengths. In general, 4 to 6 mm needles should be sufficiently long. A hard container for the disposal of used needle. Step 1. Remove the pan cap. Clean the tip of the pan with an alcohol swab. Step 2. Remove the protective tab from the needle then attach the needle to the pan and screw tightly onto the pan. Remove the outer needle cap and put it aside. Remove and discard the inner cap. Pan devices should be primed according to the manufacturer instructions before each injection to remove any air bubbles and ensure that the pan and the needles are working properly. Some pans require 2 units and others require 3 units. Step 3. Prime the insulin pan to remove air bubbles and ensure that the needle is working properly. To do so, turn the dose selector to 2 units for this pan. Hold the pan with the needle pointing upwards and tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles will rise upwards towards the needle. Press the dosing button all the way till the dose selector turns to zero. Check and make sure you see a drop of insulin appearing at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the priming. Step 4. Check that the dose selector is set at zero after the safety check and turn to the required dose as ordered. Dr. David has prescribed 16 units. Turn the dose selector slowly until you see the number 16 lining out with the pointer. Let's try to do the injection now. Step 5. Clean the injection side with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry. Grip the pan firmly and insert the needle perpendicularly into the skin. Inject the insulin slowly. Lean people should consider using the Shouters needle 4mm and lifting a skin fold for injection. Press the dosing button all the way until the marking zero lines out with the pointer. Continue to press the dosing button and start counting slowly to 10. This is to ensure you have received the full dose of insulin. Redraw the needle before releasing the skin fold if applicable. Importantly, you should not inject true clothing. Step 6. Cover the needle with the big outer needle cap tightly and use it to unscrew the needle from the pan. Step 7. You will need a sharp container to discard the used needle. Now put the pan cap back. You can purchase sharp container from selected pharmacist. When the container is full, seal it before disposing of it. You must not discard used needle into regular rubbish beans. Insulin pan needles are only meant to be used just once to avoid the risk of infections. Besides, reusing needles will make them blunt and subsequent injection may hurt and cause bruising. You may inject over the abdomen within the following areas. Up to 1cm below the lowest rib, 1cm away from amyloid laterally towards the flanks and 1cm above the synthesis pubis. Injection sites should be rotated to avoid repeat tissue trauma. A good way for rotation will be to divide the injection sites into quadrants using one per week and moving quadrants to quadrants in a consistent direction. Injections should be rotated in such a way that there are space at least 1cm from each other. Rotating your injection sites will help prevent lumps and hardened tissue from forming. The new unopened insulin pans are to be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius. Insulin pan must not be frozen. Do remember to label each pan with a date when you have opened it. Aspired insulin must not be used. Thank you, Neswifen, for the detailed explanation and guidance. You're welcome."}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 1}}
