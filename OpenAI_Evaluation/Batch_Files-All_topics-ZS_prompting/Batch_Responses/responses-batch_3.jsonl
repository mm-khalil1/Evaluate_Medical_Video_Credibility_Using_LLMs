It mentions the \"turkey baster technique\" as a specific solution for couples facing difficulties with natural ejaculation during intercourse. However, it does not offer a clear range of multiple treatment choices. The sole focus remains on self-insemination without touching upon other potential fertility treatments or interventions such as IVF, artificial insemination techniques besides self-insemination, or medical therapies.

The video seems more focused on presenting a particular solution directly to the audience, rather than showcasing any interactive or collaborative decision-making processes.
