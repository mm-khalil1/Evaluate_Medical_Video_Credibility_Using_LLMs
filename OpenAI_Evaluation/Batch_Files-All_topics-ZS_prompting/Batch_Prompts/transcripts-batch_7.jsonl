Welcome back to our video series for June Migraine Awareness Month. The topic today is a fairly large one. We're going to talk through the third group of headaches, collectively called the trigeminal autonomic cephaloges or TACs for short. Now these are considered the most debilitating and severe migraines that anyone can experience. So within this third group we have four main primary headache disorders and you may have heard of these in the past. They include most commonly, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemikrania, short lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival tearing or SUNCT for short and lastly hemikrania continua. Do you know whether you suffer from these headaches? These headache types all present very similarly with only little differentiating factors that separate them. So hopefully today's talk will make it a little bit clearer as to whether or not you may be a sufferer. So today we're going to talk specifically about cluster headaches. According to the Headache International Society, cluster headaches are a rare type of headache, affecting only around 0.1% of the population and affecting males 5-6 times more often than females. Although cluster headaches are uncommon, they are regarded as excruciating and the absolute worst form of headache that you can experience. Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as the suicide headache. The pain experienced is of a severe to extreme nature and has been reported by female sufferers to be worse than the pain of childbirth. Attacks occur in clusters with the duration of attacks anywhere from 15 to 180 minutes and may occur anywhere from 8 times per day to once every second day. The cluster can last for weeks or months followed by weeks or months of remission, i.e. headache-free periods. It affects one side of the head with pain most commonly around, behind or above the eye and or the temporal region. Associated symptoms can include red and watery eye, runny or congested nose and swelling and drooping of the eyelid. Patients may also experience sweating of the forehead and the face on the side of their symptoms during an attack. So what is the cause of cluster headache? As with many forms of headache, the cause of cluster headache was previously unknown. Medical professionals have been prescribing medications such as tryptans which have been effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough to catch the headache. The effect of tryptans, as most doctors originally thought, was that it predominantly works by helping prevent dilatation of the blood vessels in the head to stop migraines. However, recent studies have shown that dilatation and expansion of the blood vessels are no different to those suffering from a migraine and those who are not. More importantly, the physiology of blood vessels in the head during a cluster headache does not expand, yet patients still benefit from medications such as tryptans. So what is going on? Research that has been conducted over the last 15 years has found that the primary contributing factor of cluster headaches can potentially be a disorder originating in the neck, specifically a fault in the upper cervical spine resulting in a sensitized brain stem which can then induce cluster headaches. Recent research has discovered that tryptans not only help to reduce the dilatation of the blood vessels, but more importantly inhibits information received from the cervical afferents i.e. the nerve endings in the neck. This in turn decreases signals sent to the brain stem and inhibits pain travelling into the head. This information now indicates that cluster headaches and migraines can be a direct result of a sensitized brain stem. Here at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic, we are experts in treating headaches and migraines as well as cluster headaches. A thorough examination of the upper cervical spine is initiated to determine the severity of your sensitized brain stem. If you have been found to have a sensitized brain stem and that to be the cause of your cluster headaches, then treatment can begin. The best part about the treatment is that it does not require the use of medication nor any surgery. It is non-invasive and it is completely safe. Hopefully today's video gave you a better idea about cluster headaches. Again if you are a headache sufferer or if this sounds like something that you experience, we can help. So feel free to leave a comment below or message us directly or you can give us a call on 1800 HEADACHE to get started on treating your headaches and migraines. Thanks very much for listening in today guys, I'll see you in the next video."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Welcome back to our video series for June Migraine Awareness Month. The topic today is a fairly large one. We're going to talk through the third group of headaches, collectively called the trigeminal autonomic cephaloges or TACs for short. Now these are considered the most debilitating and severe migraines that anyone can experience. So within this third group we have four main primary headache disorders and you may have heard of these in the past. They include most commonly, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemikrania, short lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival tearing or SUNCT for short and lastly hemikrania continua. Do you know whether you suffer from these headaches? These headache types all present very similarly with only little differentiating factors that separate them. So hopefully today's talk will make it a little bit clearer as to whether or not you may be a sufferer. So today we're going to talk specifically about cluster headaches. According to the Headache International Society, cluster headaches are a rare type of headache, affecting only around 0.1% of the population and affecting males 5-6 times more often than females. Although cluster headaches are uncommon, they are regarded as excruciating and the absolute worst form of headache that you can experience. Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as the suicide headache. The pain experienced is of a severe to extreme nature and has been reported by female sufferers to be worse than the pain of childbirth. Attacks occur in clusters with the duration of attacks anywhere from 15 to 180 minutes and may occur anywhere from 8 times per day to once every second day. The cluster can last for weeks or months followed by weeks or months of remission, i.e. headache-free periods. It affects one side of the head with pain most commonly around, behind or above the eye and or the temporal region. Associated symptoms can include red and watery eye, runny or congested nose and swelling and drooping of the eyelid. Patients may also experience sweating of the forehead and the face on the side of their symptoms during an attack. So what is the cause of cluster headache? As with many forms of headache, the cause of cluster headache was previously unknown. Medical professionals have been prescribing medications such as tryptans which have been effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough to catch the headache. The effect of tryptans, as most doctors originally thought, was that it predominantly works by helping prevent dilatation of the blood vessels in the head to stop migraines. However, recent studies have shown that dilatation and expansion of the blood vessels are no different to those suffering from a migraine and those who are not. More importantly, the physiology of blood vessels in the head during a cluster headache does not expand, yet patients still benefit from medications such as tryptans. So what is going on? Research that has been conducted over the last 15 years has found that the primary contributing factor of cluster headaches can potentially be a disorder originating in the neck, specifically a fault in the upper cervical spine resulting in a sensitized brain stem which can then induce cluster headaches. Recent research has discovered that tryptans not only help to reduce the dilatation of the blood vessels, but more importantly inhibits information received from the cervical afferents i.e. the nerve endings in the neck. This in turn decreases signals sent to the brain stem and inhibits pain travelling into the head. This information now indicates that cluster headaches and migraines can be a direct result of a sensitized brain stem. Here at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic, we are experts in treating headaches and migraines as well as cluster headaches. A thorough examination of the upper cervical spine is initiated to determine the severity of your sensitized brain stem. If you have been found to have a sensitized brain stem and that to be the cause of your cluster headaches, then treatment can begin. The best part about the treatment is that it does not require the use of medication nor any surgery. It is non-invasive and it is completely safe. Hopefully today's video gave you a better idea about cluster headaches. Again if you are a headache sufferer or if this sounds like something that you experience, we can help. So feel free to leave a comment below or message us directly or you can give us a call on 1800 HEADACHE to get started on treating your headaches and migraines.

Welcome back to our video series for June Migraine Awareness Month. The topic today is a fairly large one. We're going to talk through the third group of headaches, collectively called the trigeminal autonomic cephaloges or TACs for short. Now these are considered the most debilitating and severe migraines that anyone can experience. So within this third group we have four main primary headache disorders and you may have heard of these in the past. They include most commonly, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemikrania, short lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival tearing or SUNCT for short and lastly hemikrania continua. Do you know whether you suffer from these headaches? These headache types all present very similarly with only little differentiating factors that separate them. So hopefully today's talk will make it a little bit clearer as to whether or not you may be a sufferer. So today we're going to talk specifically about cluster headaches. According to the Headache International Society, cluster headaches are a rare type of headache, affecting only around 0.1% of the population and affecting males 5-6 times more often than females. Although cluster headaches are uncommon, they are regarded as excruciating and the absolute worst form of headache that you can experience. Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as the suicide headache. The pain experienced is of a severe to extreme nature and has been reported by female sufferers to be worse than the pain of childbirth. Attacks occur in clusters with the duration of attacks anywhere from 15 to 180 minutes and may occur anywhere from 8 times per day to once every second day. The cluster can last for weeks or months followed by weeks or months of remission, i.e. headache-free periods. It affects one side of the head with pain most commonly around, behind or above the eye and or the temporal region. Associated symptoms can include red and watery eye, runny or congested nose and swelling and drooping of the eyelid. Patients may also experience sweating of the forehead and the face on the side of their symptoms during an attack. So what is the cause of cluster headache? As with many forms of headache, the cause of cluster headache was previously unknown. Medical professionals have been prescribing medications such as tryptans which have been effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough to catch the headache. The effect of tryptans, as most doctors originally thought, was that it predominantly works by helping prevent dilatation of the blood vessels in the head to stop migraines. However, recent studies have shown that dilatation and expansion of the blood vessels are no different to those suffering from a migraine and those who are not. More importantly, the physiology of blood vessels in the head during a cluster headache does not expand, yet patients still benefit from medications such as tryptans. So what is going on? Research that has been conducted over the last 15 years has found that the primary contributing factor of cluster headaches can potentially be a disorder originating in the neck, specifically a fault in the upper cervical spine resulting in a sensitized brain stem which can then induce cluster headaches. Recent research has discovered that tryptans not only help to reduce the dilatation of the blood vessels, but more importantly inhibits information received from the cervical afferents i.e. the nerve endings in the neck. This in turn decreases signals sent to the brain stem and inhibits pain travelling into the head. This information now indicates that cluster headaches and migraines can be a direct result of a sensitized brain stem. Here at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic, we are experts in treating headaches and migraines as well as cluster headaches. A thorough examination of the upper cervical spine is initiated to determine the severity of your sensitized brain stem. If you have been found to have a sensitized brain stem and that to be the cause of your cluster headaches, then treatment can begin. The best part about the treatment is that it does not require the use of medication nor any surgery. It is non-invasive and it is completely safe. Hopefully today's video gave you a better idea about cluster headaches. Again if you are a headache sufferer or if this sounds like something that you experience, we can help.

Your eye is going to explode. Steve learned they're called cluster headaches because they occur in groups every day for weeks or months, then disappear for extended periods, which is different from migraines. Cluster pain is short. The attacks are almost always less than 90 minutes. Migraine attacks last four to seventy-two hours with nausea, sensitivity to light and sound. Cluster travels with redness of the eye, drooping of the lid. Now there may be a non-drug, non-interventional way to get relief from cluster headaches. It's a small battery-powered external nerve stimulator called GammaCore that's used as soon as a cluster headache comes on. The attacks are incredibly intense, but also brief, so giving a drug that takes a couple of hours to kick in like an oral medication is sort of pointless. The GammaCore device is placed over the area of the neck where the vagus nerve travels. It delivers mild electrical stimulation through the skin to the vagus. The impulses are thought to travel up to the brain stem where they short-circuit the headache. A couple of double-blind studies that show a large number of people are pain-free 15 minutes after treating with the vagus nerve stimulator. The GammaCore has just been cleared by the FDA, so it probably won't be available in the U.S. until this fall. Price has not yet been set, but it is expected to be covered by insurance.

Enroll in our online course now! Link is in the video description. Hi and welcome back to Physiotutors! Headaches can manifest on their own but are also a very common symptom in neck pain patients as more than 60% of patients with a primary neck pain complaint report of having concordant episodes of headache. Therefore, it's essential to find out what kind of headache the patient is suffering from. to start off, let's differentiate between primary and secondary types of headaches. But what does this mean? Simply put, primary headaches are a disease themselves, whereas in secondary headaches, the headache is a symptom of another condition. So primary headaches would be migraines, tension-type headaches and cluster headaches. Secondary-type headaches are headaches caused by tumors, hemorrhage, other trauma ,TMJ dysfunction, substance overuse or neck pain aka the cervicogenic headache. Now, let's take a closer look at cluster headaches which are primary-type headaches.- Cluster headaches have a one-year prevalence of 53 per 100,000 people around the world with men being affected around 3 to 4 times more often than women at the age of 20 to 40. In order for a headache to qualify as cluster headache it has to fulfill certain criteria: A. at least 5 attacks need to fulfill criteria B-D. B. an untreated episode lasts 15 to 180 minutes and shows a severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and or temporal pain. C. it matches either or both of the following: 1. at least one of the following signs and symptoms ipsilateral to the headache: conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation, nasal congestion, and/or rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and/or ptosis. 2. A sense of restlessness or agitation. There are reports of patients pacing back and forth through the room banging their heads due to the severe pain. D. It occurs with a frequency between one every other day and eight per day. Tools you can use to assess the impact of a headache on your patient are, for example, the HIT-6 questionnaire which you can find in the video description down below. Also note that it can be difficult for our patient to answer all of the questions on duration, intensity and characteristics of their headache during your initial assessment. Therefore asking them to complete a headache diary can help in the assessment and management of the headache and you should be aware that there can be an overlap between multiple headaches disorders. Okay, you can check out another headache presentation on the left.

Therefore, it's essential to find out what kind of headache the patient is suffering from. to start off, let's differentiate between primary and secondary types of headaches. But what does this mean? Simply put, primary headaches are a disease themselves, whereas in secondary headaches, the headache is a symptom of another condition. So primary headaches would be migraines, tension-type headaches and cluster headaches. Secondary-type headaches are headaches caused by tumors, hemorrhage, other trauma ,TMJ dysfunction, substance overuse or neck pain aka the cervicogenic headache. Now, let's take a closer look at cluster headaches which are primary-type headaches.- Cluster headaches have a one-year prevalence of 53 per 100,000 people around the world with men being affected around 3 to 4 times more often than women at the age of 20 to 40. In order for a headache to qualify as cluster headache it has to fulfill certain criteria: A. at least 5 attacks need to fulfill criteria B-D. B. an untreated episode lasts 15 to 180 minutes and shows a severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and or temporal pain. C. it matches either or both of the following: 1. at least one of the following signs and symptoms ipsilateral to the headache: conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation, nasal congestion, and/or rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and/or ptosis. 2. A sense of restlessness or agitation. There are reports of patients pacing back and forth through the room banging their heads due to the severe pain. D. It occurs with a frequency between one every other day and eight per day. Tools you can use to assess the impact of a headache on your patient are, for example, the HIT-6 questionnaire which you can find in the video description down below. Also note that it can be difficult for our patient to answer all of the questions on duration, intensity and characteristics of their headache during your initial assessment. Therefore asking them to complete a headache diary can help in the assessment and management of the headache and you should be aware that there can be an overlap between multiple headaches disorders. Okay, you can check out another headache presentation on the left.

I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. So Eddie, tell me what's going on with your jaw. What's happening? I had clicks when I opened and closed it. This joint right here clicks and I'm grinding my teeth. How long has this been going on? Oh, probably 8 or 9 years maybe. But it's only really gotten bad the last couple months. Did you have any treatment for that? No. Okay, so can you explain to me what kind of symptoms you have because of this clicking? I get headaches and teeth grinding. So how long have you been experiencing the headaches? Three months. And how much headaches from 0 to 10 and where do you feel the headaches? Normally about 3 to 4 and the headaches will be kind of behind my eyes to the back of my head back here. What time of the day is it constant or it comes and goes? Pretty constant. Constant, okay. So you said when is the worst headache in the morning, later morning? Do you have any other symptoms than that? No. Any fullness in the ear ringing? Oh, the ear ringing, yes. Can you explain to me, do you clench, grind? During the day I'll just kind of have my jaw together like this but I don't really grind it. At night time I wear a mouth guard and I grind at night. You grind your teeth at night. So everything we do should not aggravate your symptoms. So currently you feel headache right in here, yeah? Mhm. And how much is now? Right now about 3 to 4. 3 or 4, okay. So you feel it right in here? Yeah. Okay. Have you had any head trauma or accidents? No. So the problem that you clench at night of grinding, that would start your headache? Yeah. Mhm. And you said you grind your teeth, your teeth start to worn out now? Yeah. Okay. And the ringing, excuse me, where do you have it, both ears or one ear? Both ears. Okay. Feel any pain with that? No. Okay. Any trouble opening your jaw? No. Okay. Okay. You feel those bumps here? Yeah. That's scar tissue. Oh really? Yeah. So when you clench at night or grind your teeth, let's say you did that for 5 hours. So it's similar like you are in the gym doing one single exercise for 5 hours. So you are going to have a micro-terrain in the muscle. Oh okay. And then the body has to build the scar tissue, it's part of healing. So that's why it's common with TMG to have those grinding like that scar tissue around the temporal area here. And our muscle should act like a rubber band when it contracts and relaxes. When you have a scar tissue, it's like you have a knot in the rubber band. So when your muscle contracts, it does not stretch. Okay. So when you finish your grind at night, so this muscle starts to get tight, starts to compress on your nerves and arteries and could cause headache symptoms. That's where I feel that. It's common with TMG, jaw pain, that patients have tension headaches. Usually a lot of patients can feel it more in the morning when they wake up from tension a lot at night. Is that too much? No. But you did not have a head trauma did you? No. Do you feel pressure behind your eyes? Sometimes that might be, I have some allergies when the weather changes and stuff. But the headache is normally behind the eyes. Okay so tell me, can you feel any different now? Yeah it feels better. Zero to ten now? Yeah maybe a zero to one. I feel a little bit but not much at all. Just cut back in here? Maybe towards the top more just because the sides don't bother me anymore. Can you tell where the scar tissue is more? It's around your temporalis. That's right. It's like the shape of the temporalis is like half butterfly wings. Now will that ever go away? Can scar tissue go away? Yeah we can help to break down the scar tissue. As long as you don't clench again you're not going to build scar tissue. So I'm going to go over with you after the video what we can do to prevent and decrease the clenching so you know there will be no reason for building scar tissue. Can you notice when I'm working on it that the thickness and the bump feeling on the scar tissue starts to decrease. I'm just shaving it. Sorry I messed up your hair. Oh that's alright. I don't even comb it anymore. Just kind of shake it out. I just cut really short I don't worry about it. You do the same thing like me? Just wash my hair. Just make sure to cover the little bolt I have. You keep as much as you can just so you don't get sunburn. It's not so fair and complex. So you said your headache has been constant for how long now? Probably the last 3 months it's been the worst but it kind of comes and goes. My whole life I remember. Again it's just kind of a dull pain. It's not anything that stops me from doing anything. But it's been nagging for the last 3 months. So tell me how do you feel now from 0 to 10? More like a 0. It feels a lot better. Any other symptoms? No I just feel my teeth kind of in the back or sore. I'm going to work on decreasing the clenching so you don't feel soreness. Soreness in the teeth from a lot of clenching. The headache feels a lot better. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? So far it's worked. Definitely the headache going away is nice. It's easier to concentrate at work. That's awesome.

I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. So Eddie, tell me what's going on with your jaw. What's happening? I had clicks when I opened and closed it. This joint right here clicks and I'm grinding my teeth. How long has this been going on? Oh, probably 8 or 9 years maybe. But it's only really gotten bad the last couple months. Did you have any treatment for that? No. Okay, so can you explain to me what kind of symptoms you have because of this clicking? I get headaches and teeth grinding. So how long have you been experiencing the headaches? Three months. And how much headaches from 0 to 10 and where do you feel the headaches? Normally about 3 to 4 and the headaches will be kind of behind my eyes to the back of my head back here. What time of the day is it constant or it comes and goes? Pretty constant. Constant, okay. So you said when is the worst headache in the morning, later morning? Do you have any other symptoms than that? No. Any fullness in the ear ringing? Oh, the ear ringing, yes. Can you explain to me, do you clench, grind? During the day I'll just kind of have my jaw together like this but I don't really grind it. At night time I wear a mouth guard and I grind at night. You grind your teeth at night. So everything we do should not aggravate your symptoms. So currently you feel headache right in here, yeah? Mhm. And how much is now? Right now about 3 to 4. 3 or 4, okay. So you feel it right in here? Yeah. Okay. Have you had any head trauma or accidents? No. So the problem that you clench at night of grinding, that would start your headache? Yeah. Mhm. And you said you grind your teeth, your teeth start to worn out now? Yeah. Okay. And the ringing, excuse me, where do you have it, both ears or one ear? Both ears. Okay. Feel any pain with that? No. Okay. Any trouble opening your jaw? No. Okay. Okay. You feel those bumps here? Yeah. That's scar tissue. Oh really? Yeah. So when you clench at night or grind your teeth, let's say you did that for 5 hours. So it's similar like you are in the gym doing one single exercise for 5 hours. So you are going to have a micro-terrain in the muscle. Oh okay. And then the body has to build the scar tissue, it's part of healing. So that's why it's common with TMG to have those grinding like that scar tissue around the temporal area here. And our muscle should act like a rubber band when it contracts and relaxes. When you have a scar tissue, it's like you have a knot in the rubber band. So when your muscle contracts, it does not stretch. Okay. So when you finish your grind at night, so this muscle starts to get tight, starts to compress on your nerves and arteries and could cause headache symptoms. That's where I feel that. It's common with TMG, jaw pain, that patients have tension headaches. Usually a lot of patients can feel it more in the morning when they wake up from tension a lot at night. Is that too much? No. But you did not have a head trauma did you? No. Do you feel pressure behind your eyes? Sometimes that might be, I have some allergies when the weather changes and stuff. But the headache is normally behind the eyes. Okay so tell me, can you feel any different now? Yeah it feels better. Zero to ten now? Yeah maybe a zero to one. I feel a little bit but not much at all. Just cut back in here? Maybe towards the top more just because the sides don't bother me anymore. Can you tell where the scar tissue is more? It's around your temporalis. That's right. It's like the shape of the temporalis is like half butterfly wings. Now will that ever go away? Can scar tissue go away? Yeah we can help to break down the scar tissue. As long as you don't clench again you're not going to build scar tissue. So I'm going to go over with you after the video what we can do to prevent and decrease the clenching so you know there will be no reason for building scar tissue. Can you notice when I'm working on it that the thickness and the bump feeling on the scar tissue starts to decrease. I'm just shaving it. Sorry I messed up your hair. Oh that's alright. I don't even comb it anymore. Just kind of shake it out. I just cut really short I don't worry about it. You do the same thing like me? Just wash my hair. Just make sure to cover the little bolt I have. You keep as much as you can just so you don't get sunburn. It's not so fair and complex. So you said your headache has been constant for how long now? Probably the last 3 months it's been the worst but it kind of comes and goes. My whole life I remember. Again it's just kind of a dull pain. It's not anything that stops me from doing anything. But it's been nagging for the last 3 months. So tell me how do you feel now from 0 to 10? More like a 0. It feels a lot better. Any other symptoms? No I just feel my teeth kind of in the back or sore. I'm going to work on decreasing the clenching so you don't feel soreness. Soreness in the teeth from a lot of clenching. The headache feels a lot better. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? So far it's worked. Definitely the headache going away is nice. It's easier to concentrate at work. That's awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you. Sure. Please subscribe to my channel to get helpful tips on how to relieve pain.

Probably the last 3 months it's been the worst but it kind of comes and goes. My whole life I remember. Again it's just kind of a dull pain. It's not anything that stops me from doing anything. But it's been nagging for the last 3 months. So tell me how do you feel now from 0 to 10? More like a 0. It feels a lot better. Any other symptoms? No I just feel my teeth kind of in the back or sore. I'm going to work on decreasing the clenching so you don't feel soreness. Soreness in the teeth from a lot of clenching. The headache feels a lot better. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? So far it's worked. Definitely the headache going away is nice. It's easier to concentrate at work. That's awesome.

I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. So Eddie, tell me what's going on with your jaw. What's happening? I had clicks when I opened and closed it. This joint right here clicks and I'm grinding my teeth. How long has this been going on? Oh, probably 8 or 9 years maybe. But it's only really gotten bad the last couple months. Did you have any treatment for that? No. Okay, so can you explain to me what kind of symptoms you have because of this clicking? I get headaches and teeth grinding. So how long have you been experiencing the headaches? Three months. And how much headaches from 0 to 10 and where do you feel the headaches? Normally about 3 to 4 and the headaches will be kind of behind my eyes to the back of my head back here. What time of the day is it constant or it comes and goes? Pretty constant. Constant, okay. So you said when is the worst headache in the morning, later morning? Do you have any other symptoms than that? No. Any fullness in the ear ringing? Oh, the ear ringing, yes. Can you explain to me, do you clench, grind? During the day I'll just kind of have my jaw together like this but I don't really grind it. At night time I wear a mouth guard and I grind at night. You grind your teeth at night. So everything we do should not aggravate your symptoms. So currently you feel headache right in here, yeah? Mhm. And how much is now? Right now about 3 to 4. 3 or 4, okay. So you feel it right in here? Yeah. Okay. Have you had any head trauma or accidents? No. So the problem that you clench at night of grinding, that would start your headache? Yeah. Mhm. And you said you grind your teeth, your teeth start to worn out now? Yeah. Okay. And the ringing, excuse me, where do you have it, both ears or one ear? Both ears. Okay. Feel any pain with that? No. Okay. Any trouble opening your jaw? No. Okay. Okay. You feel those bumps here? Yeah. That's scar tissue. Oh really? Yeah. So when you clench at night or grind your teeth, let's say you did that for 5 hours. So it's similar like you are in the gym doing one single exercise for 5 hours. So you are going to have a micro-terrain in the muscle. Oh okay. And then the body has to build the scar tissue, it's part of healing. So that's why it's common with TMG to have those grinding like that scar tissue around the temporal area here. And our muscle should act like a rubber band when it contracts and relaxes. When you have a scar tissue, it's like you have a knot in the rubber band. So when your muscle contracts, it does not stretch. Okay. So when you finish your grind at night, so this muscle starts to get tight, starts to compress on your nerves and arteries and could cause headache symptoms. That's where I feel that. It's common with TMG, jaw pain, that patients have tension headaches. Usually a lot of patients can feel it more in the morning when they wake up from tension a lot at night. Is that too much? No. But you did not have a head trauma did you? No. Do you feel pressure behind your eyes? Sometimes that might be, I have some allergies when the weather changes and stuff. But the headache is normally behind the eyes. Okay so tell me, can you feel any different now? Yeah it feels better. Zero to ten now? Yeah maybe a zero to one. I feel a little bit but not much at all. Just cut back in here? Maybe towards the top more just because the sides don't bother me anymore. Can you tell where the scar tissue is more? It's around your temporalis. That's right. It's like the shape of the temporalis is like half butterfly wings. Now will that ever go away? Can scar tissue go away? Yeah we can help to break down the scar tissue. As long as you don't clench again you're not going to build scar tissue. So I'm going to go over with you after the video what we can do to prevent and decrease the clenching so you know there will be no reason for building scar tissue. Can you notice when I'm working on it that the thickness and the bump feeling on the scar tissue starts to decrease. I'm just shaving it. Sorry I messed up your hair. Oh that's alright. I don't even comb it anymore. Just kind of shake it out. I just cut really short I don't worry about it. You do the same thing like me? Just wash my hair. Just make sure to cover the little bolt I have. You keep as much as you can just so you don't get sunburn. It's not so fair and complex. So you said your headache has been constant for how long now?

I feel a little bit but not much at all. Just cut back in here? Maybe towards the top more just because the sides don't bother me anymore. Can you tell where the scar tissue is more? It's around your temporalis. That's right. It's like the shape of the temporalis is like half butterfly wings. Now will that ever go away? Can scar tissue go away? Yeah we can help to break down the scar tissue. As long as you don't clench again you're not going to build scar tissue. So I'm going to go over with you after the video what we can do to prevent and decrease the clenching so you know there will be no reason for building scar tissue. Can you notice when I'm working on it that the thickness and the bump feeling on the scar tissue starts to decrease. I'm just shaving it. Sorry I messed up your hair. Oh that's alright. I don't even comb it anymore. Just kind of shake it out. I just cut really short I don't worry about it. You do the same thing like me? Just wash my hair. Just make sure to cover the little bolt I have. You keep as much as you can just so you don't get sunburn. It's not so fair and complex. So you said your headache has been constant for how long now? Probably the last 3 months it's been the worst but it kind of comes and goes. My whole life I remember. Again it's just kind of a dull pain. It's not anything that stops me from doing anything. But it's been nagging for the last 3 months. So tell me how do you feel now from 0 to 10? More like a 0. It feels a lot better. Any other symptoms? No I just feel my teeth kind of in the back or sore. I'm going to work on decreasing the clenching so you don't feel soreness. Soreness in the teeth from a lot of clenching. The headache feels a lot better. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? So far it's worked. Definitely the headache going away is nice. It's easier to concentrate at work. That's awesome.

I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. So Eddie, tell me what's going on with your jaw. What's happening? I had clicks when I opened and closed it. This joint right here clicks and I'm grinding my teeth. How long has this been going on? Oh, probably 8 or 9 years maybe. But it's only really gotten bad the last couple months. Did you have any treatment for that? No. Okay, so can you explain to me what kind of symptoms you have because of this clicking? I get headaches and teeth grinding. So how long have you been experiencing the headaches? Three months. And how much headaches from 0 to 10 and where do you feel the headaches? Normally about 3 to 4 and the headaches will be kind of behind my eyes to the back of my head back here. What time of the day is it constant or it comes and goes? Pretty constant. Constant, okay. So you said when is the worst headache in the morning, later morning? Do you have any other symptoms than that? No. Any fullness in the ear ringing? Oh, the ear ringing, yes. Can you explain to me, do you clench, grind? During the day I'll just kind of have my jaw together like this but I don't really grind it. At night time I wear a mouth guard and I grind at night. You grind your teeth at night. So everything we do should not aggravate your symptoms. So currently you feel headache right in here, yeah? Mhm. And how much is now? Right now about 3 to 4. 3 or 4, okay. So you feel it right in here? Yeah. Okay. Have you had any head trauma or accidents? No. So the problem that you clench at night of grinding, that would start your headache? Yeah. Mhm. And you said you grind your teeth, your teeth start to worn out now? Yeah. Okay. And the ringing, excuse me, where do you have it, both ears or one ear? Both ears. Okay. Feel any pain with that? No. Okay. Any trouble opening your jaw? No. Okay. Okay. You feel those bumps here? Yeah. That's scar tissue. Oh really? Yeah. So when you clench at night or grind your teeth, let's say you did that for 5 hours. So it's similar like you are in the gym doing one single exercise for 5 hours. So you are going to have a micro-terrain in the muscle. Oh okay. And then the body has to build the scar tissue, it's part of healing. So that's why it's common with TMG to have those grinding like that scar tissue around the temporal area here. And our muscle should act like a rubber band when it contracts and relaxes. When you have a scar tissue, it's like you have a knot in the rubber band. So when your muscle contracts, it does not stretch. Okay. So when you finish your grind at night, so this muscle starts to get tight, starts to compress on your nerves and arteries and could cause headache symptoms. That's where I feel that. It's common with TMG, jaw pain, that patients have tension headaches. Usually a lot of patients can feel it more in the morning when they wake up from tension a lot at night. Is that too much? No. But you did not have a head trauma did you? No. Do you feel pressure behind your eyes? Sometimes that might be, I have some allergies when the weather changes and stuff. But the headache is normally behind the eyes. Okay so tell me, can you feel any different now? Yeah it feels better. Zero to ten now? Yeah maybe a zero to one.

I'm just being very muscly, okay Okay I've been suffering from what I thought was toothache for about five months I went down to see the doctor and literally begged her to make the headache stop because I couldn't take anymore She asked me what sort of pain it was how I felt Thought it might be migraines, but asked me to come back in a couple of days time She bless her took the time to investigate my complaint and diagnosed me with something called cluster headaches So You've you've missed your tablet I have I am two hours late to take me tablets that are due to take them six o'clock And it's quite a strict regime. I have to take them four times a day If I don't this is how I get at the moment.

I've been on the floor just screaming and hollering before. Anyway, that's what a cluster headache is like for me.

Okay, say like you did that. And then after an hour or so it goes away. Then the next night, 2.06, the person with the device is back, yanking your eye out through the top of your head again. You get up, you roll around, you grab your head like you're going crazy, and then 15-20 minutes later it gets slightly bearable. And then after about an hour or so it sort of just goes away like it was never there. You start to think, oh hey, I guess maybe I have a brain tumor and I'm about to die, I better get my things in order. So anyway, you kind of recover, everything's fine. So you go to bed the next night, 2.06, your friend's back with the tool. So this goes on for like 5 days and then just stops. Never forget about it, but it stops so it's not a big deal anymore. So then you go about your business and a year later, a year later, calendar year later, 2.06, you wake up with excruciating pain and your friend is back after a year in Provence or something. Anyway, and it starts all over again. Those are what are called cluster headaches and I'm one of the lucky recipients of the cluster headache. So it took me a long time to figure out what this was. The weird thing about them is they're harmless. The most excruciating pain known to man. Mostly men get them, mostly men in their 20s, 30s and 40s and then a lot of times they just go away on their own. Some women do get them and the women that have got them have said they're far more painful and more severe than anything related to childbirth. This is some serious pain I'm telling you about. Once you've experienced this, there's nothing you can imagine that's more excruciating. The nickname for them is also suicide headaches and they've shown up throughout history and people have known about them for a long time. They don't seem to have any ill effects and they don't seem to cause any lasting problems which is sort of shocking considering how excruciating these things are. Literally a grown man rolling around on the floor, tears coming out of your eyes, your nose is running just out of excruciating pain and it's so painful you cannot even think. It's impossible to even form a thought. You're lucky if you can get into the bathroom and slug down a couple of aspirin in hopes. I don't even know if that helps. I'm a mild sufferer. So there's people that have chronic cluster or suicide headaches. So my sympathy is out to y'all. I hope this helps enlighten somebody out there. But I would say if you are having any problem like this, go see a doctor. But look into what cluster headaches are first so you can kind of explain that to him because you don't want this to be something worse. But there's things a lot more deadly. Over and out. Hope this helps."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Okay, say like you did that. And then after an hour or so it goes away. Then the next night, 2.06, the person with the device is back, yanking your eye out through the top of your head again. You get up, you roll around, you grab your head like you're going crazy, and then 15-20 minutes later it gets slightly bearable. And then after about an hour or so it sort of just goes away like it was never there. You start to think, oh hey, I guess maybe I have a brain tumor and I'm about to die, I better get my things in order. So anyway, you kind of recover, everything's fine. So you go to bed the next night, 2.06, your friend's back with the tool. So this goes on for like 5 days and then just stops. Never forget about it, but it stops so it's not a big deal anymore. So then you go about your business and a year later, a year later, calendar year later, 2.06, you wake up with excruciating pain and your friend is back after a year in Provence or something. Anyway, and it starts all over again. Those are what are called cluster headaches and I'm one of the lucky recipients of the cluster headache. So it took me a long time to figure out what this was. The weird thing about them is they're harmless. The most excruciating pain known to man. Mostly men get them, mostly men in their 20s, 30s and 40s and then a lot of times they just go away on their own. Some women do get them and the women that have got them have said they're far more painful and more severe than anything related to childbirth. This is some serious pain I'm telling you about. Once you've experienced this, there's nothing you can imagine that's more excruciating. The nickname for them is also suicide headaches and they've shown up throughout history and people have known about them for a long time. They don't seem to have any ill effects and they don't seem to cause any lasting problems which is sort of shocking considering how excruciating these things are. Literally a grown man rolling around on the floor, tears coming out of your eyes, your nose is running just out of excruciating pain and it's so painful you cannot even think. It's impossible to even form a thought. You're lucky if you can get into the bathroom and slug down a couple of aspirin in hopes. I don't even know if that helps. I'm a mild sufferer. So there's people that have chronic cluster or suicide headaches. So my sympathy is out to y'all. I hope this helps enlighten somebody out there. But I would say if you are having any problem like this, go see a doctor. But look into what cluster headaches are first so you can kind of explain that to him because you don't want this to be something worse. But there's things a lot more deadly. Over and out.

I've been suffering with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches? Suicide headaches? Whatever you want to call them. The beast. It's... How can you explain it unless you have to deal with it? No one will ever understand. Just us. Well anyway, like I say, I've had them since I was 21. I'm 43 years old now. I want to show some of you out there how to split your jabs because I've been reading some of the comments and some of you are just using the whole EpiPen. I split my injections so I can get 8 injections in 2 days instead of 2 injections in a 24 hour period. You might be familiar with these. They come in a different format. I'm going to show you them in a minute. This is how I split these. So there's the trigger mechanism. You need to pull that off. Do not push that button. We all know. That's the trigger. Then you need to break the seal. The seal's broken. Now, then you need to pull it apart. It can be quite difficult. It takes a little bit of time. A little bit of a wiggle. That's how that comes out. Grab hold of that again. Do not push that button. It fries that apart. And that's what you're left with. 40 pounds apparently. Now on here you've got some little stoppers. Either side. Stop that from falling out. So you can bite them open or cut them. A pair of scissors. Cut one side. And the other. Now this will just slide out. He says. OK. And that's what you're left with. Some of these have more than... Some of them have more in them than others for some reason. I'm not sure why. I'm going to sort of say I only take two in a 24 hour period. But what I do with this. I'm going to put this in a syringe. If you can't get hold of needles. You can just use this. And that's what I did for many years. I would get a cotton bud. I would put that in my upper thigh. And I would administer. Maybe half or a quarter. As soon as the attack started. As soon as I had an inkling. And it would just go. After five minutes it would go. And it was more or less the same as having a hole here. And then just feeling absolutely crap. Because it just used to knock the stuffing out of me. Having a whole one of these just used to put me on my back. So like I say. Luckily I've got a friend that gets me these. Sounds so dodgy doesn't it. But they're actually diabetic. You can't get them from your doctors. You can go to chemists and ask for them. They think you're addicted to something. But you know I just don't care. You can get one of them. Okay so this is going to go in here. And you just gently squeeze it in. Okay. So that's full. You can get the bubbles out of it. As usual it's just. You will. You just keep tapping it. Get the bubbles all out. You'll end up with that. Okay. So it goes one to four. And that's usually what you get in there. Sometimes you get five. But for me that's my hit. So out of this I get four injections. Just out of one EpiPen. Two EpiPens. Eight injections. Over a 24 hour period. And that's how I've been coping. As soon as they occur. Especially when they're chronic. I just take a shot. I've got my own little case. I preload these. I do it sort of every other day. So you know I preload my pens. And this has been my survival. If you're not getting these. I mean. Many years ago I was getting these. And these were so easy to use. And I found out on Ouch! how to split these. And they were just so easy. So you take the pen out. And some of you may well be getting these. I went to pick up a prescription and they gave me these after three years of getting those pens. So I'm not quite sure. Anyway. Stick that in there. Twist there. Pull it out. And that's ready to go. That's what you would inject. Instead of that. And twist the end. Pull it out. And there you go. How easy was that? I wish I got these every time. But I don't. So that's how I split my jabs. And like I say. I would administer this. In my upper thigh. I hate injections. But because of the pain. We all know what the pain is about. Nothing compares. So I know. Just a little prick. So to speak. It's going to make me feel a lot more better than if I didn't. Okay. I hope this helps. Email me or message me with any other questions. I might be able to answer them or help you a little bit. Just remember. You are not alone. I've been suffering this for as long as I can imagine. It's crippling. It sucks. But there are people out there that care and understand. I've never actually spoken about it before. I just go for it on my own. But it's wonderful to hear from and listen to other people's stories. And to see how they're coping. Just another thing. That I found out is supposed to be really good. Veraptamol. I've tried it. Unsuccessfully for me. It might help other people. When you go to the doctors. Do not leave that doctor until they've prescribed you the injections. Or these. You must have the injections and the oxygen. Get an appointment straight away. A neurologist. I know it takes forever. But once diagnosed. They can't refuse to give you these injections. When I pick up a repeat prescription. I get these. I get ten of these. Sometimes I get twelve. I'm not paying \u00a37.80 a throw. Whatever it is for just two of these. I'm going in and picking up a bag of ten. And I'm surviving. Peace out people. Love you lots."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I've been suffering with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches? Suicide headaches? Whatever you want to call them. The beast. It's... How can you explain it unless you have to deal with it? No one will ever understand. Just us. Well anyway, like I say, I've had them since I was 21. I'm 43 years old now. I want to show some of you out there how to split your jabs because I've been reading some of the comments and some of you are just using the whole EpiPen. I split my injections so I can get 8 injections in 2 days instead of 2 injections in a 24 hour period. You might be familiar with these. They come in a different format. I'm going to show you them in a minute. This is how I split these. So there's the trigger mechanism. You need to pull that off. Do not push that button. We all know. That's the trigger. Then you need to break the seal. The seal's broken. Now, then you need to pull it apart. It can be quite difficult. It takes a little bit of time. A little bit of a wiggle. That's how that comes out. Grab hold of that again. Do not push that button. It fries that apart. And that's what you're left with. 40 pounds apparently. Now on here you've got some little stoppers. Either side. Stop that from falling out. So you can bite them open or cut them. A pair of scissors. Cut one side. And the other. Now this will just slide out. He says. OK. And that's what you're left with. Some of these have more than... Some of them have more in them than others for some reason. I'm not sure why. I'm going to sort of say I only take two in a 24 hour period. But what I do with this. I'm going to put this in a syringe. If you can't get hold of needles. You can just use this. And that's what I did for many years. I would get a cotton bud. I would put that in my upper thigh. And I would administer. Maybe half or a quarter. As soon as the attack started. As soon as I had an inkling. And it would just go. After five minutes it would go. And it was more or less the same as having a hole here. And then just feeling absolutely crap. Because it just used to knock the stuffing out of me. Having a whole one of these just used to put me on my back. So like I say. Luckily I've got a friend that gets me these. Sounds so dodgy doesn't it. But they're actually diabetic. You can't get them from your doctors. You can go to chemists and ask for them. They think you're addicted to something. But you know I just don't care. You can get one of them. Okay so this is going to go in here. And you just gently squeeze it in. Okay. So that's full. You can get the bubbles out of it. As usual it's just. You will. You just keep tapping it. Get the bubbles all out. You'll end up with that. Okay. So it goes one to four. And that's usually what you get in there. Sometimes you get five. But for me that's my hit. So out of this I get four injections. Just out of one EpiPen. Two EpiPens. Eight injections. Over a 24 hour period. And that's how I've been coping. As soon as they occur. Especially when they're chronic. I just take a shot. I've got my own little case. I preload these. I do it sort of every other day. So you know I preload my pens. And this has been my survival. If you're not getting these. I mean. Many years ago I was getting these. And these were so easy to use. And I found out on Ouch! how to split these. And they were just so easy. So you take the pen out. And some of you may well be getting these. I went to pick up a prescription and they gave me these after three years of getting those pens. So I'm not quite sure. Anyway. Stick that in there. Twist there. Pull it out. And that's ready to go. That's what you would inject. Instead of that. And twist the end. Pull it out. And there you go. How easy was that? I wish I got these every time. But I don't. So that's how I split my jabs. And like I say. I would administer this. In my upper thigh. I hate injections. But because of the pain. We all know what the pain is about. Nothing compares. So I know. Just a little prick. So to speak. It's going to make me feel a lot more better than if I didn't. Okay. I hope this helps. Email me or message me with any other questions. I might be able to answer them or help you a little bit. Just remember. You are not alone. I've been suffering this for as long as I can imagine. It's crippling. It sucks. But there are people out there that care and understand. I've never actually spoken about it before. I just go for it on my own. But it's wonderful to hear from and listen to other people's stories. And to see how they're coping. Just another thing. That I found out is supposed to be really good. Veraptamol. I've tried it. Unsuccessfully for me. It might help other people. When you go to the doctors. Do not leave that doctor until they've prescribed you the injections. Or these. You must have the injections and the oxygen. Get an appointment straight away. A neurologist. I know it takes forever. But once diagnosed. They can't refuse to give you these injections. When I pick up a repeat prescription. I get these. I get ten of these. Sometimes I get twelve. I'm not paying \u00a37.80 a throw. Whatever it is for just two of these.

I've been suffering with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches? Suicide headaches? Whatever you want to call them. The beast. It's... How can you explain it unless you have to deal with it? No one will ever understand. Just us. Well anyway, like I say, I've had them since I was 21. I'm 43 years old now. I want to show some of you out there how to split your jabs because I've been reading some of the comments and some of you are just using the whole EpiPen. I split my injections so I can get 8 injections in 2 days instead of 2 injections in a 24 hour period. You might be familiar with these. They come in a different format. I'm going to show you them in a minute. This is how I split these. So there's the trigger mechanism. You need to pull that off. Do not push that button. We all know. That's the trigger. Then you need to break the seal. The seal's broken. Now, then you need to pull it apart. It can be quite difficult. It takes a little bit of time. A little bit of a wiggle. That's how that comes out. Grab hold of that again. Do not push that button. It fries that apart. And that's what you're left with. 40 pounds apparently. Now on here you've got some little stoppers. Either side. Stop that from falling out. So you can bite them open or cut them. A pair of scissors. Cut one side. And the other. Now this will just slide out. He says. OK. And that's what you're left with. Some of these have more than... Some of them have more in them than others for some reason. I'm not sure why. I'm going to sort of say I only take two in a 24 hour period. But what I do with this. I'm going to put this in a syringe. If you can't get hold of needles. You can just use this. And that's what I did for many years. I would get a cotton bud. I would put that in my upper thigh. And I would administer. Maybe half or a quarter. As soon as the attack started. As soon as I had an inkling. And it would just go. After five minutes it would go. And it was more or less the same as having a hole here. And then just feeling absolutely crap. Because it just used to knock the stuffing out of me. Having a whole one of these just used to put me on my back. So like I say. Luckily I've got a friend that gets me these. Sounds so dodgy doesn't it. But they're actually diabetic. You can't get them from your doctors. You can go to chemists and ask for them. They think you're addicted to something. But you know I just don't care. You can get one of them. Okay so this is going to go in here. And you just gently squeeze it in. Okay. So that's full. You can get the bubbles out of it. As usual it's just. You will. You just keep tapping it. Get the bubbles all out. You'll end up with that. Okay. So it goes one to four. And that's usually what you get in there. Sometimes you get five. But for me that's my hit. So out of this I get four injections. Just out of one EpiPen. Two EpiPens. Eight injections. Over a 24 hour period. And that's how I've been coping. As soon as they occur. Especially when they're chronic. I just take a shot. I've got my own little case. I preload these. I do it sort of every other day. So you know I preload my pens. And this has been my survival. If you're not getting these. I mean. Many years ago I was getting these. And these were so easy to use. And I found out on Ouch! how to split these. And they were just so easy. So you take the pen out. And some of you may well be getting these. I went to pick up a prescription and they gave me these after three years of getting those pens. So I'm not quite sure. Anyway. Stick that in there. Twist there. Pull it out. And that's ready to go. That's what you would inject. Instead of that. And twist the end. Pull it out. And there you go. How easy was that? I wish I got these every time. But I don't. So that's how I split my jabs. And like I say. I would administer this. In my upper thigh. I hate injections. But because of the pain. We all know what the pain is about. Nothing compares. So I know. Just a little prick. So to speak. It's going to make me feel a lot more better than if I didn't. Okay. I hope this helps. Email me or message me with any other questions. I might be able to answer them or help you a little bit. Just remember. You are not alone. I've been suffering this for as long as I can imagine.

I'm 43 years old. I've been suffering with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches? Suicide headaches? Whatever you want to call them. The beast. It's... How can you explain it unless you have to deal with it? No one will ever understand. Just us. Well anyway, like I say, I've had them since I was 21. I'm 43 years old now. I want to show some of you out there how to split your jabs because I've been reading some of the comments and some of you are just using the whole EpiPen. I split my injections so I can get 8 injections in 2 days instead of 2 injections in a 24 hour period. You might be familiar with these. They come in a different format. I'm going to show you them in a minute. This is how I split these. So there's the trigger mechanism. You need to pull that off. Do not push that button. We all know. That's the trigger. Then you need to break the seal. The seal's broken. Now, then you need to pull it apart. It can be quite difficult. It takes a little bit of time. A little bit of a wiggle. That's how that comes out. Grab hold of that again. Do not push that button. It fries that apart. And that's what you're left with. 40 pounds apparently. Now on here you've got some little stoppers. Either side. Stop that from falling out. So you can bite them open or cut them. A pair of scissors. Cut one side. And the other. Now this will just slide out. He says. OK. And that's what you're left with. Some of these have more than... Some of them have more in them than others for some reason. I'm not sure why. I'm going to sort of say I only take two in a 24 hour period. But what I do with this. I'm going to put this in a syringe. If you can't get hold of needles. You can just use this. And that's what I did for many years. I would get a cotton bud. I would put that in my upper thigh. And I would administer. Maybe half or a quarter. As soon as the attack started. As soon as I had an inkling. And it would just go. After five minutes it would go. And it was more or less the same as having a hole here. And then just feeling absolutely crap. Because it just used to knock the stuffing out of me. Having a whole one of these just used to put me on my back. So like I say. Luckily I've got a friend that gets me these. Sounds so dodgy doesn't it. But they're actually diabetic. You can't get them from your doctors. You can go to chemists and ask for them. They think you're addicted to something. But you know I just don't care. You can get one of them. Okay so this is going to go in here. And you just gently squeeze it in. Okay. So that's full. You can get the bubbles out of it. As usual it's just. You will. You just keep tapping it. Get the bubbles all out. You'll end up with that. Okay. So it goes one to four. And that's usually what you get in there. Sometimes you get five. But for me that's my hit. So out of this I get four injections. Just out of one EpiPen. Two EpiPens. Eight injections. Over a 24 hour period. And that's how I've been coping. As soon as they occur. Especially when they're chronic. I just take a shot. I've got my own little case. I preload these. I do it sort of every other day. So you know I preload my pens. And this has been my survival. If you're not getting these. I mean. Many years ago I was getting these. And these were so easy to use. And I found out on Ouch! how to split these. And they were just so easy. So you take the pen out. And some of you may well be getting these. I went to pick up a prescription and they gave me these after three years of getting those pens. So I'm not quite sure. Anyway. Stick that in there. Twist there. Pull it out. And that's ready to go. That's what you would inject. Instead of that. And twist the end. Pull it out. And there you go. How easy was that? I wish I got these every time. But I don't. So that's how I split my jabs. And like I say. I would administer this. In my upper thigh. I hate injections. But because of the pain. We all know what the pain is about. Nothing compares. So I know. Just a little prick. So to speak. It's going to make me feel a lot more better than if I didn't. Okay. I hope this helps. Email me or message me with any other questions. I might be able to answer them or help you a little bit. Just remember. You are not alone. I've been suffering this for as long as I can imagine. It's crippling. It sucks. But there are people out there that care and understand. I've never actually spoken about it before. I just go for it on my own. But it's wonderful to hear from and listen to other people's stories. And to see how they're coping. Just another thing. That I found out is supposed to be really good. Veraptamol. I've tried it.

Now look, he told me, and I'm just telling you, I'm not a doctor, but I told my friends about these headache cures and they keep texting me and emailing me saying, this headache cure saved my life, how come I've never heard about it? The reason you haven't heard about it is because the medical world isn't going to make any money off these. So here they are. First off, if you already have a headache, Coca-Cola, caffeine, and carbonation together, great for headaches, but better yet, you want to stop this headache when you feel the aura. There's a certain feeling somebody gets, they know after they've had migraines before in cluster headaches, they can feel it coming earlier before the headache starts, the little clue it's coming. When you feel that, grab a rag, a cold rag, put it behind the back of your neck. Close your eyes and sit in a dark room. That's one thing. Here's the other thing. Oxygen. 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. Once you feel the onset, the early precursor to that headache, 100% oxygen, 10 minutes, your headache will either not come or it will come greatly reduced. So let me know what you think. And I hope you feel better."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

My role is planning manager which means I spend maybe two days a week sat in front of a computer analysing all the information I've got. I love coming home mainly because I love my wife.

Dad doesn't drive, has never driven apart from driving people mad or being a backseat driver. So I take them and do their weekly shopping with them.

It's everything I want in a pub. I spend as much time as I can with my wife. We're fortunate that they've got very similar tastes.

And a few years ago when they set up a cricket team they asked the volunteers to help. I had time on my hands so I went along. I'm undergoing training as a scorer. My wife is one of the coaches. I go along and hopefully add the numbers up. I knew that having a profession that involved numbers one day would drag me down and here we are. Out of nowhere I get a bright shiny headache that starts off in my left eye. And I know within a matter of seconds I'm going to be a necky. My left eye will close and droop. My eye will be watering cochlearly as if I'm crying on one side of my face. But the obvious give away is the fact that I'm going to be curled up in the fetal position. Wrapping my arms around my head and curled up. Stamping, stamping my feet. Hitting whatever is near me. And I hit things so that my hand hurts and takes my mind off the pain. If I am fortunate enough to be able to move then I carry an injection kit with me. And it is... It's a miracle because if I can manage to load the injection and if I can manage to inject myself, within five minutes the pain will be gone.

My role is planning manager which means I spend maybe two days a week sat in front of a computer analysing all the information I've got. I love coming home mainly because I love my wife. So I know that as I'm walking up the road through the path, through the woods, I know I'm only a couple of minutes away from a hug with my wife. She is the mainstay of my day. We've got a great house. It's an end of terrace, three bedroom, nice quiet road. It's great. It's a lovely place to live. It's a nice area. Now I live in Chandler's Ford. It's a much much bigger place but it's got that same homely friendly atmosphere. My parents are both in their 80s. My mum has just had this major surgery. Dad doesn't drive, has never driven apart from driving people mad or being a backseat driver. So I take them and do their weekly shopping with them. My brother as well as being my brother is my best friend. And like good friends do, we enjoy a pint. So we've got a very very good real ale pub a few miles from where he lives. So I pick them up and we go and have a pint. It does us both good. I love real ales and this is a dying breed this pub. It's a proper pub. It has real ales and it's got a dark horse. It's everything I want in a pub. I spend as much time as I can with my wife. We're fortunate that they've got very similar tastes. She will come motor racing with me to watch the racing and to make sure that I don't get into trouble. And I will go to her to visually impaired cricket. And a few years ago when they set up a cricket team they asked the volunteers to help. I had time on my hands so I went along. I'm undergoing training as a scorer. My wife is one of the coaches. I go along and hopefully add the numbers up. I knew that having a profession that involved numbers one day would drag me down and here we are. Out of nowhere I get a bright shiny headache that starts off in my left eye. And I know within a matter of seconds I'm going to be a necky. My left eye will close and droop. My eye will be watering cochlearly as if I'm crying on one side of my face. But the obvious give away is the fact that I'm going to be curled up in the fetal position. Wrapping my arms around my head and curled up. Stamping, stamping my feet. Hitting whatever is near me. And I hit things so that my hand hurts and takes my mind off the pain. If I am fortunate enough to be able to move then I carry an injection kit with me. And it is... It's a miracle because if I can manage to load the injection and if I can manage to inject myself, within five minutes the pain will be gone. If I can't I'm looking at 20 to 30 minutes of seriously, seriously wishing I was dead. Which is why they're called suicide headaches. I don't have any phobias. But I am scared of the beast. I can't hide from it. I can't run from it. It's with me all the time and I carry it with me. That's what the beast has done to me.

There's no strings attached. I just really want to help. I had them for seven years. I had them on both sides of my face. I used to rage anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour and a half to two hours. Sometimes maybe four or five hours the whole night. What I used to do is I used to have got to bed when I went to bed. Before I went to bed I went to sleep. I got everything ready. It was a hot water bottle. I used to get a hot water bottle and a bean bag in the microwave. I had a bucket of ice as well. Next to my bed I had my oxygen and a carrier case. I need to take it around. What I used to do with this I had this kind of attachment and I actually used to use the cold air that was coming out of here to cool the inside of my gums. What causes a cluster headache is many many theories and all that kind of stuff has been suggested. There's one doctor Dr. Elliot Schevel who at the headache clinic did a ligation in an artery that runs my upper jaw. Basically what happens is the blood vessel dilates, squeezes the nerve against the trigeminal nerve against the bone and wears the mileage heath away and short circuits the nerve telling the brain that your face has been ripped off. So you've got chronic nose, eye, teeth ache, your ear aches and you want to rub and cry and pace and scream and sway and yeah it was pretty bad. My lifestyle never went out. I knew at night I used to get them. I never used to drink. I couldn't enjoy other people's food. Just to fear there was things that would trigger it off that were in the food and I sort of narrowed it down to basically any drink that's carbonated used to narrow it down. I had to stop smoking because just the smoking would induce it. MSG, monosodium glutamate, modified starch, too much sugar, preservatives, fruit juices, dried fruits, anything like that would trigger this headache. Even a fisherman's that fisherman mint used to do. I used to sleep upright so I never I didn't lie flat and basically it's a very nasty headache to live with and I suggested if anything I'm saying to you sounds familiar I suggest you get hold of the headache clinic find out what they do and how they do it. You can contact them, you can phone them, you can also contact get onto the website the website is www.theheadacheclinic.co.za and you can also find Dr. Chaville's work and procedures that have been put onto Wikipedia. He's been doing this since 1995. He's got a state of life facility and I suggest you go and take your life back and that's really what I did. I have my life back so I also want to take this opportunity if Dr. Chaville if you are listening I want to just thank you and your team of nurses your specialized nurses and your state of life facilities for giving me back my life. I didn't know I could have been it was so easy and so quick to get cured and I'm completely completely headache free. I can drink beer, I can have starch, I can eat a slab of chocolate. It's just wonderful getting your life back and watching also how happy people are that this has affected because really this does affect the loved ones around you they don't know what to do how to look after you how they can help you and it's a very stressful time for them as well. So for you for your loved ones I suggest you get hold of Dr. Chaville at the headache clinic and let him take care of you because he's a pioneer in this industry and he knows exactly what's going on and you won't be the first if you're coming from the end of the earth you won't be the first and you won't be the last.

It has been 25 months since my last headache and believe me I don't want another one, let alone another cycle. These are just some of the treatments that I used and what I would do again and what I would do differently. First off let me just tell you about two websites clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters. Google them, they are a wealth of information for us who suffer with them and also family members that have to deal with us. So I strongly advise you check those out. I was 20 years old when they started, 19 or 20 and I landed on aspirin, not just aspirin, but anacin because of the caffeine in it. Excedrin would work too but it upset my stomach more so I was on anacin my whole life and lots of it. Doc did put me in the first 10 years on inderol for about 3 years and I don't remember having that any effect whatsoever so I got off of it. I took a lot of aspirin, too many but you know you want to get rid of that headache. I never really knew when they were going to come and they only used to come one at a time, once a week, twice a week or twice a month, you just never knew. In the middle of the night, at work, at play, after sex, you name it they came and the first hint of that headache I would take to anacin and sit down and deal with it and at work I put cold towels on my face. It was his chiropractic. I swore I would never see a chiropractor. I used the word never, it bit me. So some 30 years ago I went to a chiropractor. He seemed to think he could help me. I went 3 times a week for a month and blam I woke up one morning and I just had this feeling. I knew they were gone. I had never felt that before. It was the first of many. That's how I knew my cycles were over by the way. I went one year without a headache. I had never gone a year before. Got him again, went back to the chiropractor. Went a year and a half. He suggested instead of doing it this way why don't you come once a month and try to stay in line and see if that helps. Then I went 2 and 2 and a half years. So for chiropractic I would say definitely worth a try if you haven't done it already. Also in that same time a doctor prescribed me Valium and Vicodin. And no not for the headaches. After the Valium I would take a half a Valium after the headache to relax my facial and neck muscles. I would take a half a Vicodin to take care of the residual pain. Vicodin does not treat or help a cluster headache. Do not take Vicodin. My advice. About 20 years ago I was introduced to Verapamil. My blood pressure was borderline high and Doc put me on it saying it was also preventative for the cluster headache. So I gave it a try. 240 milligrams a day. So it seemed like between the chiropractor and the Verapamil my cycles were now going to be 2 years plus without a headache. Two and a half. I did 3 twice that I remember. They pretty well settled out now a day every 2 and 3 quarter years. Don't ask me why. If I had to do something different with the Verapamil I would take half. I would go down to 120, 60 in the morning and 60 in the evening and then go back up when they came back. That's pretty much the way you read it in the ClusterHeadache.com how they do it. It's supposed to be a constipator. Never was for me for 15 years. But the last two, owie. It's not just that, it's anything. More about that later. I still remember every one of those cycles I come out of was waking up in the morning and I knew they were gone. I just knew it. That's how they ended. Next thing that came along was Imitrex. Brand new dog had samples. That was about 15 years ago. 17 maybe. What worked best for me was the 20 milligram nasal spray. All I have is injections right now. I've never used one but next ones, yikes. I only used them to take care of the really bad ones that the aspirin wouldn't do. I'd use way more than I should. It says right on the package. Use only 6 per month. I know a lot of people use a lot more and I did myself. They're not good for you. They worked for me about 80% of the time. You want to get rid of the headache so what do you do? The last thing I tried was oxygen. 15 liters per minute. I had to have that special regulator. I can tell you this. I didn't give it a fair shake but I'm telling you right now. It's working for a lot of people. You got to give this one a try. I wasn't able to give it a fair shake. I didn't get my oxygen until 3 weeks into my cycle and it was a bad cycle. Insurance authorization delivery you name it. My advice if you get oxygen and it works, buy your own equipment. Have it on hand always. That's what I'm going to work on. Try it. One thing I'm not going to comment on is mushrooms because I haven't tried them. I have them on hand right now. There's a lot of studies out there. Google it. I'm going to do a separate short video on that and my research there also. As well as the aftermath of what happened this last cycle. My hope is really that I can help one person. Really I'd like to help many. That's my hope. My last four cycles since 2005 have come two and three quarter years apart. I mean to the month. There may be something to do with the season there. I don't know. Kind of weird. They've lasted 17 to 25 days except for the very last one. It lasted 35 days and it was by far the worst cycle ever. My advice if you are diagnosed with them, get yourself the best neurologist you can get and have all the tests, brain scan, whatever they want to do. Back up any medications or treatments they want to give you or start you on with those two websites. Clusterheadaches.com, Clusterbusters and see what the users are saying about it. Very important. I can't stress that enough. Back it up. They don't know enough. Neurologists in our areas. Anyway, if you have any questions or advice for me, please leave me a comment and I will get back to you. Thanks for watching. Hang in there. You can do 40 years too. Peace. Love."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

It's supposed to be a constipator. Never was for me for 15 years. But the last two, owie. It's not just that, it's anything. More about that later. I still remember every one of those cycles I come out of was waking up in the morning and I knew they were gone. I just knew it. That's how they ended. Next thing that came along was Imitrex. Brand new dog had samples. That was about 15 years ago. 17 maybe. What worked best for me was the 20 milligram nasal spray. All I have is injections right now. I've never used one but next ones, yikes. I only used them to take care of the really bad ones that the aspirin wouldn't do. I'd use way more than I should. It says right on the package. Use only 6 per month. I know a lot of people use a lot more and I did myself. They're not good for you. They worked for me about 80% of the time. You want to get rid of the headache so what do you do? The last thing I tried was oxygen. 15 liters per minute. I had to have that special regulator. I can tell you this. I didn't give it a fair shake but I'm telling you right now. It's working for a lot of people. You got to give this one a try. I wasn't able to give it a fair shake. I didn't get my oxygen until 3 weeks into my cycle and it was a bad cycle. Insurance authorization delivery you name it. My advice if you get oxygen and it works, buy your own equipment. Have it on hand always. That's what I'm going to work on. Try it. One thing I'm not going to comment on is mushrooms because I haven't tried them. I have them on hand right now. There's a lot of studies out there. Google it. I'm going to do a separate short video on that and my research there also. As well as the aftermath of what happened this last cycle. My hope is really that I can help one person. Really I'd like to help many. That's my hope. My last four cycles since 2005 have come two and three quarter years apart. I mean to the month. There may be something to do with the season there. I don't know. Kind of weird. They've lasted 17 to 25 days except for the very last one. It lasted 35 days and it was by far the worst cycle ever. My advice if you are diagnosed with them, get yourself the best neurologist you can get and have all the tests, brain scan, whatever they want to do. Back up any medications or treatments they want to give you or start you on with those two websites. Clusterheadaches.com, Clusterbusters and see what the users are saying about it. Very important. I can't stress that enough. Back it up. They don't know enough. Neurologists in our areas. Anyway, if you have any questions or advice for me, please leave me a comment and I will get back to you. Thanks for watching. Hang in there. You can do 40 years too. Peace. Love."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

It has been 25 months since my last headache and believe me I don't want another one, let alone another cycle. These are just some of the treatments that I used and what I would do again and what I would do differently. First off let me just tell you about two websites clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters. Google them, they are a wealth of information for us who suffer with them and also family members that have to deal with us. So I strongly advise you check those out. I was 20 years old when they started, 19 or 20 and I landed on aspirin, not just aspirin, but anacin because of the caffeine in it. Excedrin would work too but it upset my stomach more so I was on anacin my whole life and lots of it. Doc did put me in the first 10 years on inderol for about 3 years and I don't remember having that any effect whatsoever so I got off of it. I took a lot of aspirin, too many but you know you want to get rid of that headache. I never really knew when they were going to come and they only used to come one at a time, once a week, twice a week or twice a month, you just never knew. In the middle of the night, at work, at play, after sex, you name it they came and the first hint of that headache I would take to anacin and sit down and deal with it and at work I put cold towels on my face. It was his chiropractic. I swore I would never see a chiropractor. I used the word never, it bit me. So some 30 years ago I went to a chiropractor. He seemed to think he could help me. I went 3 times a week for a month and blam I woke up one morning and I just had this feeling. I knew they were gone. I had never felt that before. It was the first of many. That's how I knew my cycles were over by the way. I went one year without a headache. I had never gone a year before. Got him again, went back to the chiropractor. Went a year and a half. He suggested instead of doing it this way why don't you come once a month and try to stay in line and see if that helps. Then I went 2 and 2 and a half years. So for chiropractic I would say definitely worth a try if you haven't done it already. Also in that same time a doctor prescribed me Valium and Vicodin. And no not for the headaches. After the Valium I would take a half a Valium after the headache to relax my facial and neck muscles. I would take a half a Vicodin to take care of the residual pain. Vicodin does not treat or help a cluster headache. Do not take Vicodin. My advice. About 20 years ago I was introduced to Verapamil. My blood pressure was borderline high and Doc put me on it saying it was also preventative for the cluster headache. So I gave it a try. 240 milligrams a day. So it seemed like between the chiropractor and the Verapamil my cycles were now going to be 2 years plus without a headache. Two and a half. I did 3 twice that I remember. They pretty well settled out now a day every 2 and 3 quarter years. Don't ask me why. If I had to do something different with the Verapamil I would take half.

Google them, they are a wealth of information for us who suffer with them and also family members that have to deal with us. So I strongly advise you check those out. I was 20 years old when they started, 19 or 20 and I landed on aspirin, not just aspirin, but anacin because of the caffeine in it. Excedrin would work too but it upset my stomach more so I was on anacin my whole life and lots of it. Doc did put me in the first 10 years on inderol for about 3 years and I don't remember having that any effect whatsoever so I got off of it. I took a lot of aspirin, too many but you know you want to get rid of that headache. I never really knew when they were going to come and they only used to come one at a time, once a week, twice a week or twice a month, you just never knew. In the middle of the night, at work, at play, after sex, you name it they came and the first hint of that headache I would take to anacin and sit down and deal with it and at work I put cold towels on my face. It was his chiropractic. I swore I would never see a chiropractor. I used the word never, it bit me. So some 30 years ago I went to a chiropractor. He seemed to think he could help me. I went 3 times a week for a month and blam I woke up one morning and I just had this feeling. I knew they were gone. I had never felt that before. It was the first of many. That's how I knew my cycles were over by the way. I went one year without a headache. I had never gone a year before. Got him again, went back to the chiropractor. Went a year and a half. He suggested instead of doing it this way why don't you come once a month and try to stay in line and see if that helps. Then I went 2 and 2 and a half years. So for chiropractic I would say definitely worth a try if you haven't done it already. Also in that same time a doctor prescribed me Valium and Vicodin. And no not for the headaches. After the Valium I would take a half a Valium after the headache to relax my facial and neck muscles. I would take a half a Vicodin to take care of the residual pain. Vicodin does not treat or help a cluster headache. Do not take Vicodin. My advice. About 20 years ago I was introduced to Verapamil. My blood pressure was borderline high and Doc put me on it saying it was also preventative for the cluster headache. So I gave it a try. 240 milligrams a day. So it seemed like between the chiropractor and the Verapamil my cycles were now going to be 2 years plus without a headache. Two and a half. I did 3 twice that I remember. They pretty well settled out now a day every 2 and 3 quarter years. Don't ask me why. If I had to do something different with the Verapamil I would take half. I would go down to 120, 60 in the morning and 60 in the evening and then go back up when they came back. That's pretty much the way you read it in the ClusterHeadache.com how they do it. It's supposed to be a constipator. Never was for me for 15 years. But the last two, owie. It's not just that, it's anything. More about that later. I still remember every one of those cycles I come out of was waking up in the morning and I knew they were gone. I just knew it. That's how they ended. Next thing that came along was Imitrex. Brand new dog had samples. That was about 15 years ago. 17 maybe. What worked best for me was the 20 milligram nasal spray. All I have is injections right now. I've never used one but next ones, yikes. I only used them to take care of the really bad ones that the aspirin wouldn't do. I'd use way more than I should. It says right on the package. Use only 6 per month. I know a lot of people use a lot more and I did myself. They're not good for you. They worked for me about 80% of the time. You want to get rid of the headache so what do you do? The last thing I tried was oxygen. 15 liters per minute. I had to have that special regulator. I can tell you this. I didn't give it a fair shake but I'm telling you right now. It's working for a lot of people. You got to give this one a try. I wasn't able to give it a fair shake. I didn't get my oxygen until 3 weeks into my cycle and it was a bad cycle. Insurance authorization delivery you name it. My advice if you get oxygen and it works, buy your own equipment. Have it on hand always. That's what I'm going to work on. Try it. One thing I'm not going to comment on is mushrooms because I haven't tried them. I have them on hand right now. There's a lot of studies out there. Google it. I'm going to do a separate short video on that and my research there also. As well as the aftermath of what happened this last cycle. My hope is really that I can help one person. Really I'd like to help many. That's my hope. My last four cycles since 2005 have come two and three quarter years apart. I mean to the month. There may be something to do with the season there. I don't know. Kind of weird. They've lasted 17 to 25 days except for the very last one. It lasted 35 days and it was by far the worst cycle ever. My advice if you are diagnosed with them, get yourself the best neurologist you can get and have all the tests, brain scan, whatever they want to do. Back up any medications or treatments they want to give you or start you on with those two websites. Clusterheadaches.com, Clusterbusters and see what the users are saying about it. Very important. I can't stress that enough. Back it up. They don't know enough. Neurologists in our areas. Anyway, if you have any questions or advice for me, please leave me a comment and I will get back to you. Thanks for watching. Hang in there. You can do 40 years too. Peace. Love."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I didn't give it a fair shake but I'm telling you right now. It's working for a lot of people. You got to give this one a try. I wasn't able to give it a fair shake. I didn't get my oxygen until 3 weeks into my cycle and it was a bad cycle. Insurance authorization delivery you name it. My advice if you get oxygen and it works, buy your own equipment. Have it on hand always. That's what I'm going to work on. Try it. One thing I'm not going to comment on is mushrooms because I haven't tried them. I have them on hand right now. There's a lot of studies out there. Google it. I'm going to do a separate short video on that and my research there also. As well as the aftermath of what happened this last cycle. My hope is really that I can help one person. Really I'd like to help many. That's my hope. My last four cycles since 2005 have come two and three quarter years apart. I mean to the month. There may be something to do with the season there. I don't know. Kind of weird. They've lasted 17 to 25 days except for the very last one. It lasted 35 days and it was by far the worst cycle ever. My advice if you are diagnosed with them, get yourself the best neurologist you can get and have all the tests, brain scan, whatever they want to do. Back up any medications or treatments they want to give you or start you on with those two websites. Clusterheadaches.com, Clusterbusters and see what the users are saying about it. Very important. I can't stress that enough. Back it up. They don't know enough. Neurologists in our areas. Anyway, if you have any questions or advice for me, please leave me a comment and I will get back to you. Thanks for watching. Hang in there. You can do 40 years too. Peace. Love."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

It has been 25 months since my last headache and believe me I don't want another one, let alone another cycle. These are just some of the treatments that I used and what I would do again and what I would do differently. First off let me just tell you about two websites clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters. Google them, they are a wealth of information for us who suffer with them and also family members that have to deal with us. So I strongly advise you check those out. I was 20 years old when they started, 19 or 20 and I landed on aspirin, not just aspirin, but anacin because of the caffeine in it. Excedrin would work too but it upset my stomach more so I was on anacin my whole life and lots of it. Doc did put me in the first 10 years on inderol for about 3 years and I don't remember having that any effect whatsoever so I got off of it. I took a lot of aspirin, too many but you know you want to get rid of that headache. I never really knew when they were going to come and they only used to come one at a time, once a week, twice a week or twice a month, you just never knew. In the middle of the night, at work, at play, after sex, you name it they came and the first hint of that headache I would take to anacin and sit down and deal with it and at work I put cold towels on my face. It was his chiropractic. I swore I would never see a chiropractor. I used the word never, it bit me. So some 30 years ago I went to a chiropractor. He seemed to think he could help me. I went 3 times a week for a month and blam I woke up one morning and I just had this feeling. I knew they were gone. I had never felt that before. It was the first of many. That's how I knew my cycles were over by the way. I went one year without a headache. I had never gone a year before. Got him again, went back to the chiropractor. Went a year and a half. He suggested instead of doing it this way why don't you come once a month and try to stay in line and see if that helps. Then I went 2 and 2 and a half years. So for chiropractic I would say definitely worth a try if you haven't done it already. Also in that same time a doctor prescribed me Valium and Vicodin. And no not for the headaches. After the Valium I would take a half a Valium after the headache to relax my facial and neck muscles. I would take a half a Vicodin to take care of the residual pain. Vicodin does not treat or help a cluster headache. Do not take Vicodin. My advice. About 20 years ago I was introduced to Verapamil. My blood pressure was borderline high and Doc put me on it saying it was also preventative for the cluster headache. So I gave it a try. 240 milligrams a day. So it seemed like between the chiropractor and the Verapamil my cycles were now going to be 2 years plus without a headache. Two and a half. I did 3 twice that I remember. They pretty well settled out now a day every 2 and 3 quarter years. Don't ask me why. If I had to do something different with the Verapamil I would take half. I would go down to 120, 60 in the morning and 60 in the evening and then go back up when they came back. That's pretty much the way you read it in the ClusterHeadache.com how they do it. It's supposed to be a constipator. Never was for me for 15 years. But the last two, owie. It's not just that, it's anything. More about that later. I still remember every one of those cycles I come out of was waking up in the morning and I knew they were gone. I just knew it. That's how they ended. Next thing that came along was Imitrex. Brand new dog had samples. That was about 15 years ago. 17 maybe. What worked best for me was the 20 milligram nasal spray. All I have is injections right now. I've never used one but next ones, yikes. I only used them to take care of the really bad ones that the aspirin wouldn't do. I'd use way more than I should. It says right on the package. Use only 6 per month. I know a lot of people use a lot more and I did myself. They're not good for you. They worked for me about 80% of the time.

I started getting headaches on August the 4th. I have a new MD. He called in Emmetrex Oral for me. I went and I picked up nine of them that my insurance covered and I was getting headaches every six to eight hours. They didn't last very long. I went back to get more and discovered that they were going to cost me $20 a pill because my insurance wouldn't cover them when I asked the pharmacist why. She said they discovered that sumatriptin causes rebound headaches. I was like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? And so the very thing that's supposed to stop them causes them to rebound. Well anyhow, sumatriptin is the only thing that knocks out headaches for me. I haven't had them in three years and I hadn't heard about the oxygen until recently and I'll talk about that later. So anyhow, I get concerned and I decide to go to my MD. Well I had taken like 20 sumatriptin by the time I get to him and they prescribed for me prednisone and topamax to offset the headaches. Well it did work for two and a half days. I didn't have headaches and then they started again and they were like 16 hours apart and 18 hours apart. And then they got closer and closer together. Well I'm taking sumatriptin again and so I get concerned, I go back in and I meet with my MD and they decide to prescribe for me panelor. Well on the third trip they told me I need to go see a neurologist. I'm like okay, well I schedule an appointment with a neurologist but they gave me the panelor. One pill at night. So I want you to see this. I'm already taking cholesterol medicine. I'm on topamax, prednisone, sumatriptin and now panelor. Five prescription medications going into my body. And I took it that night. The next morning I woke up and it felt like a steamroller had rolled over me. I couldn't even get out of bed hardly. I was 45 minutes late waking up, which I'm an internet marketer. It doesn't matter, I work out of my house. But I still had work to do, you know. Well anyway I got up, got some coffee, started feeling a little bit better and decided to go to the YMCA and work out. Feeling very lethargic though. I went there and it's a weight class that I take for about an hour and I noticed like halfway through the class I started having like these intense hot flashes and I felt like I was off in a dreamy, dreamy, real light headed dream world. Hard to explain. Anyway I finished the class and I knew something just wasn't right. I just did not feel good at all. I had to go to my son-in-law's office, he's a chiropractor, to get an adjustment. He started asking me about the headaches and said, what medicine are you on? Well I had just told him a couple days before some of the medicines I was on and I couldn't remember when he asked me. This time I'm sitting in front of him and it was like my brain was totally shot down. And I had to ask him and he told me all day was like that. It was like I had dementia. I couldn't remember things. I would walk into the kitchen to do something and I would stand there and I'd think, why am I in here? And I couldn't figure it out. I slept for like four hours. Just awful, awful, awful, awful experience with pain lord. It felt like something exploded in my body. Hot flashes and just out in la-la land. Not good at all. So I didn't take it anymore. Well I was supposed to increase the dosage of the Topamax two days later. Actually I wasn't supposed to see the neurologist for about a week. So I increased the dose on the Topamax and the third day of increasing the dose on the Topamax, I didn't even notice. It was like such a subtle thing that happened that it became normal behavior but it was very abnormal. I would notice that I was in my right mind for a while, like ten minutes or so. And I'd be like, oh I'm feeling good. You know the medicine's working. And then I would go through this phase where I'm like, oh my gosh, I am not in my right mind. There's something really wrong with me. And then when I would be in my right mind I would convince myself, do not take that medicine again. It's not working. You're still getting headaches. Oh that's the other thing that happened with the Pamela. After the Pamela, my headaches started like every six hours again. Or they were like 15, 12 hours apart with all craziness. So anyway, I'm in this altered state with the Topamax and I would convince myself don't take it and then I would convince myself to take it. And then after I would take it when I was in my right mind, I'd be like, I can't believe you actually took that. You should go throw that up. And then I would say, no, just leave it in there. It's supposed to work. Extreme anxiety, memory loss. And let me tell you something about the headaches. When I increased the dose of the Topamax, I have never ever had intense cluster headaches like I experienced. They were like freight trains running through my brain. I have never experienced pain like that in my life. And I've had cluster headaches for 25 years. So the intensity of the headaches increased and the medicine wasn't stopping them quick enough. They ramped up even quicker with the Topamax. So anyway, I called the doctor. He said, don't take it anymore. Get off that stuff. Well, I went and met with a neurologist and the neurologist tells me that Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. He said it nicely. He said, you know, MDs, they do the best that they can. But my neurologist is a headache specialist. He's been treating people with headaches for 20 years and he has a lot of cluster headache patients. He said that cluster headaches and migraines are two separate things. Topamax is only, it's like a last resort whenever people have migraines and they're chronic, getting them all the time. And he said to get to the dose of Topamax that it actually takes to help, he said most people can't get through the side effects. But anyway, Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. That's what he told me. So he's the expert. I'm just sharing that with you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I went and I picked up nine of them that my insurance covered and I was getting headaches every six to eight hours. They didn't last very long.

He's been treating people with headaches for 20 years and he has a lot of cluster headache patients. He said that cluster headaches and migraines are two separate things. Topamax is only, it's like a last resort whenever people have migraines and they're chronic, getting them all the time. And he said to get to the dose of Topamax that it actually takes to help, he said most people can't get through the side effects. But anyway, Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. That's what he told me. So he's the expert. I'm just sharing that with you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I started getting headaches on August the 4th. I have a new MD. He called in Emmetrex Oral for me. I went and I picked up nine of them that my insurance covered and I was getting headaches every six to eight hours. They didn't last very long. I went back to get more and discovered that they were going to cost me $20 a pill because my insurance wouldn't cover them when I asked the pharmacist why. She said they discovered that sumatriptin causes rebound headaches. I was like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? And so the very thing that's supposed to stop them causes them to rebound. Well anyhow, sumatriptin is the only thing that knocks out headaches for me. I haven't had them in three years and I hadn't heard about the oxygen until recently and I'll talk about that later. So anyhow, I get concerned and I decide to go to my MD. Well I had taken like 20 sumatriptin by the time I get to him and they prescribed for me prednisone and topamax to offset the headaches. Well it did work for two and a half days. I didn't have headaches and then they started again and they were like 16 hours apart and 18 hours apart. And then they got closer and closer together. Well I'm taking sumatriptin again and so I get concerned, I go back in and I meet with my MD and they decide to prescribe for me panelor. Well on the third trip they told me I need to go see a neurologist. I'm like okay, well I schedule an appointment with a neurologist but they gave me the panelor. One pill at night. So I want you to see this. I'm already taking cholesterol medicine. I'm on topamax, prednisone, sumatriptin and now panelor. Five prescription medications going into my body. And I took it that night. The next morning I woke up and it felt like a steamroller had rolled over me. I couldn't even get out of bed hardly. I was 45 minutes late waking up, which I'm an internet marketer. It doesn't matter, I work out of my house. But I still had work to do, you know. Well anyway I got up, got some coffee, started feeling a little bit better and decided to go to the YMCA and work out. Feeling very lethargic though. I went there and it's a weight class that I take for about an hour and I noticed like halfway through the class I started having like these intense hot flashes and I felt like I was off in a dreamy, dreamy, real light headed dream world. Hard to explain. Anyway I finished the class and I knew something just wasn't right. I just did not feel good at all. I had to go to my son-in-law's office, he's a chiropractor, to get an adjustment. He started asking me about the headaches and said, what medicine are you on? Well I had just told him a couple days before some of the medicines I was on and I couldn't remember when he asked me. This time I'm sitting in front of him and it was like my brain was totally shot down. And I had to ask him and he told me all day was like that. It was like I had dementia. I couldn't remember things. I would walk into the kitchen to do something and I would stand there and I'd think, why am I in here? And I couldn't figure it out. I slept for like four hours. Just awful, awful, awful, awful experience with pain lord. It felt like something exploded in my body. Hot flashes and just out in la-la land. Not good at all. So I didn't take it anymore. Well I was supposed to increase the dosage of the Topamax two days later. Actually I wasn't supposed to see the neurologist for about a week. So I increased the dose on the Topamax and the third day of increasing the dose on the Topamax, I didn't even notice. It was like such a subtle thing that happened that it became normal behavior but it was very abnormal. I would notice that I was in my right mind for a while, like ten minutes or so. And I'd be like, oh I'm feeling good. You know the medicine's working. And then I would go through this phase where I'm like, oh my gosh, I am not in my right mind. There's something really wrong with me. And then when I would be in my right mind I would convince myself, do not take that medicine again. It's not working. You're still getting headaches. Oh that's the other thing that happened with the Pamela. After the Pamela, my headaches started like every six hours again. Or they were like 15, 12 hours apart with all craziness. So anyway, I'm in this altered state with the Topamax and I would convince myself don't take it and then I would convince myself to take it. And then after I would take it when I was in my right mind, I'd be like, I can't believe you actually took that. You should go throw that up. And then I would say, no, just leave it in there. It's supposed to work. Extreme anxiety, memory loss. And let me tell you something about the headaches. When I increased the dose of the Topamax, I have never ever had intense cluster headaches like I experienced. They were like freight trains running through my brain. I have never experienced pain like that in my life. And I've had cluster headaches for 25 years. So the intensity of the headaches increased and the medicine wasn't stopping them quick enough. They ramped up even quicker with the Topamax. So anyway, I called the doctor. He said, don't take it anymore. Get off that stuff. Well, I went and met with a neurologist and the neurologist tells me that Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. He said it nicely. He said, you know, MDs, they do the best that they can. But my neurologist is a headache specialist.

I couldn't remember things. I would walk into the kitchen to do something and I would stand there and I'd think, why am I in here? And I couldn't figure it out. I slept for like four hours. Just awful, awful, awful, awful experience with pain lord. It felt like something exploded in my body. Hot flashes and just out in la-la land. Not good at all. So I didn't take it anymore. Well I was supposed to increase the dosage of the Topamax two days later. Actually I wasn't supposed to see the neurologist for about a week. So I increased the dose on the Topamax and the third day of increasing the dose on the Topamax, I didn't even notice. It was like such a subtle thing that happened that it became normal behavior but it was very abnormal. I would notice that I was in my right mind for a while, like ten minutes or so. And I'd be like, oh I'm feeling good. You know the medicine's working. And then I would go through this phase where I'm like, oh my gosh, I am not in my right mind. There's something really wrong with me. And then when I would be in my right mind I would convince myself, do not take that medicine again. It's not working. You're still getting headaches. Oh that's the other thing that happened with the Pamela. After the Pamela, my headaches started like every six hours again. Or they were like 15, 12 hours apart with all craziness. So anyway, I'm in this altered state with the Topamax and I would convince myself don't take it and then I would convince myself to take it. And then after I would take it when I was in my right mind, I'd be like, I can't believe you actually took that. You should go throw that up. And then I would say, no, just leave it in there. It's supposed to work. Extreme anxiety, memory loss. And let me tell you something about the headaches. When I increased the dose of the Topamax, I have never ever had intense cluster headaches like I experienced. They were like freight trains running through my brain. I have never experienced pain like that in my life. And I've had cluster headaches for 25 years. So the intensity of the headaches increased and the medicine wasn't stopping them quick enough. They ramped up even quicker with the Topamax. So anyway, I called the doctor. He said, don't take it anymore. Get off that stuff. Well, I went and met with a neurologist and the neurologist tells me that Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. He said it nicely. He said, you know, MDs, they do the best that they can. But my neurologist is a headache specialist. He's been treating people with headaches for 20 years and he has a lot of cluster headache patients. He said that cluster headaches and migraines are two separate things. Topamax is only, it's like a last resort whenever people have migraines and they're chronic, getting them all the time. And he said to get to the dose of Topamax that it actually takes to help, he said most people can't get through the side effects. But anyway, Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. That's what he told me. So he's the expert. I'm just sharing that with you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I started getting headaches on August the 4th. I have a new MD. He called in Emmetrex Oral for me. I went and I picked up nine of them that my insurance covered and I was getting headaches every six to eight hours. They didn't last very long. I went back to get more and discovered that they were going to cost me $20 a pill because my insurance wouldn't cover them when I asked the pharmacist why. She said they discovered that sumatriptin causes rebound headaches. I was like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? And so the very thing that's supposed to stop them causes them to rebound. Well anyhow, sumatriptin is the only thing that knocks out headaches for me. I haven't had them in three years and I hadn't heard about the oxygen until recently and I'll talk about that later. So anyhow, I get concerned and I decide to go to my MD. Well I had taken like 20 sumatriptin by the time I get to him and they prescribed for me prednisone and topamax to offset the headaches. Well it did work for two and a half days. I didn't have headaches and then they started again and they were like 16 hours apart and 18 hours apart. And then they got closer and closer together. Well I'm taking sumatriptin again and so I get concerned, I go back in and I meet with my MD and they decide to prescribe for me panelor. Well on the third trip they told me I need to go see a neurologist. I'm like okay, well I schedule an appointment with a neurologist but they gave me the panelor. One pill at night. So I want you to see this. I'm already taking cholesterol medicine. I'm on topamax, prednisone, sumatriptin and now panelor. Five prescription medications going into my body. And I took it that night. The next morning I woke up and it felt like a steamroller had rolled over me. I couldn't even get out of bed hardly. I was 45 minutes late waking up, which I'm an internet marketer. It doesn't matter, I work out of my house. But I still had work to do, you know. Well anyway I got up, got some coffee, started feeling a little bit better and decided to go to the YMCA and work out. Feeling very lethargic though. I went there and it's a weight class that I take for about an hour and I noticed like halfway through the class I started having like these intense hot flashes and I felt like I was off in a dreamy, dreamy, real light headed dream world. Hard to explain. Anyway I finished the class and I knew something just wasn't right. I just did not feel good at all. I had to go to my son-in-law's office, he's a chiropractor, to get an adjustment.

I went back to get more and discovered that they were going to cost me $20 a pill because my insurance wouldn't cover them when I asked the pharmacist why. She said they discovered that sumatriptin causes rebound headaches. I was like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? And so the very thing that's supposed to stop them causes them to rebound. Well anyhow, sumatriptin is the only thing that knocks out headaches for me. I haven't had them in three years and I hadn't heard about the oxygen until recently and I'll talk about that later. So anyhow, I get concerned and I decide to go to my MD. Well I had taken like 20 sumatriptin by the time I get to him and they prescribed for me prednisone and topamax to offset the headaches. Well it did work for two and a half days. I didn't have headaches and then they started again and they were like 16 hours apart and 18 hours apart. And then they got closer and closer together. Well I'm taking sumatriptin again and so I get concerned, I go back in and I meet with my MD and they decide to prescribe for me panelor. Well on the third trip they told me I need to go see a neurologist. I'm like okay, well I schedule an appointment with a neurologist but they gave me the panelor. One pill at night. So I want you to see this. I'm already taking cholesterol medicine. I'm on topamax, prednisone, sumatriptin and now panelor. Five prescription medications going into my body. And I took it that night. The next morning I woke up and it felt like a steamroller had rolled over me. I couldn't even get out of bed hardly. I was 45 minutes late waking up, which I'm an internet marketer. It doesn't matter, I work out of my house. But I still had work to do, you know. Well anyway I got up, got some coffee, started feeling a little bit better and decided to go to the YMCA and work out. Feeling very lethargic though. I went there and it's a weight class that I take for about an hour and I noticed like halfway through the class I started having like these intense hot flashes and I felt like I was off in a dreamy, dreamy, real light headed dream world. Hard to explain. Anyway I finished the class and I knew something just wasn't right. I just did not feel good at all. I had to go to my son-in-law's office, he's a chiropractor, to get an adjustment. He started asking me about the headaches and said, what medicine are you on? Well I had just told him a couple days before some of the medicines I was on and I couldn't remember when he asked me. This time I'm sitting in front of him and it was like my brain was totally shot down. And I had to ask him and he told me all day was like that. It was like I had dementia. I couldn't remember things. I would walk into the kitchen to do something and I would stand there and I'd think, why am I in here? And I couldn't figure it out. I slept for like four hours. Just awful, awful, awful, awful experience with pain lord. It felt like something exploded in my body. Hot flashes and just out in la-la land. Not good at all. So I didn't take it anymore. Well I was supposed to increase the dosage of the Topamax two days later. Actually I wasn't supposed to see the neurologist for about a week. So I increased the dose on the Topamax and the third day of increasing the dose on the Topamax, I didn't even notice. It was like such a subtle thing that happened that it became normal behavior but it was very abnormal. I would notice that I was in my right mind for a while, like ten minutes or so. And I'd be like, oh I'm feeling good. You know the medicine's working. And then I would go through this phase where I'm like, oh my gosh, I am not in my right mind. There's something really wrong with me. And then when I would be in my right mind I would convince myself, do not take that medicine again. It's not working. You're still getting headaches. Oh that's the other thing that happened with the Pamela. After the Pamela, my headaches started like every six hours again. Or they were like 15, 12 hours apart with all craziness. So anyway, I'm in this altered state with the Topamax and I would convince myself don't take it and then I would convince myself to take it. And then after I would take it when I was in my right mind, I'd be like, I can't believe you actually took that. You should go throw that up. And then I would say, no, just leave it in there. It's supposed to work. Extreme anxiety, memory loss. And let me tell you something about the headaches. When I increased the dose of the Topamax, I have never ever had intense cluster headaches like I experienced. They were like freight trains running through my brain. I have never experienced pain like that in my life. And I've had cluster headaches for 25 years. So the intensity of the headaches increased and the medicine wasn't stopping them quick enough. They ramped up even quicker with the Topamax. So anyway, I called the doctor. He said, don't take it anymore. Get off that stuff. Well, I went and met with a neurologist and the neurologist tells me that Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. He said it nicely. He said, you know, MDs, they do the best that they can. But my neurologist is a headache specialist. He's been treating people with headaches for 20 years and he has a lot of cluster headache patients. He said that cluster headaches and migraines are two separate things. Topamax is only, it's like a last resort whenever people have migraines and they're chronic, getting them all the time. And he said to get to the dose of Topamax that it actually takes to help, he said most people can't get through the side effects. But anyway, Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. That's what he told me. So he's the expert. I'm just sharing that with you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

First of all, Red Bull, I usually drink about a half of one. I take Kudzu root powder as a supplement during the day to help reduce the headaches. When I'm having an attack, I drink half of Red Bull. Any diphenhydramine allergy medicine, this is a Waldro brand. And I also take one BC powder or Goody powder because it has caffeine and it gets to the headache really quick. For the eyes, clear eyes or any Visine will help. Also what's helpful when it's allergy season is a neti pot to clear out the right side. What I normally do is I heat up some rice and I put it into a rice pack and you can tell when it's hot. And then I'll put it in a sock of any sort and I use a funnel to put it in. And then once the rice pack is full, I will rest on a couch or another hard surface and apply the heat to the side of my head that hurts the most. And it's always the right side and I think for most cluster headache sufferers, it is the right side. So this is my advice to you to do this whenever you're having an attack. I usually have one probably about an hour after I take a nap or an hour after I try to go to sleep. And most nights I do sleep on the couch when I'm going through my cycles because on the armrest I can turn my head in this fashion. For some reason it relaxes the side of my neck for the carotid artery where most of the pain comes from and generates from. But most of the pain goes up here to this part of my head. So I have to move my head and apply the pressure in different areas with the rice pack to be able to slow it down. And normally I can get it under control within 15 or 30 minutes. And also if you do not want heat, you can massage the areas and apply pressure to where it hurts the most. But again, one half of any type of Red Bull because of the taurine, one diphenhydramine, usually a 25 milligram, and one BC or goody powder in combination. If you're allergic to any of these, please do not do this. And as a supplement, it cuts the root powder and it will help you get through your cycles faster. Thank you for your time.

First of all, Red Bull, I usually drink about a half of one. I take Kudzu root powder as a supplement during the day to help reduce the headaches. When I'm having an attack, I drink half of Red Bull. Any diphenhydramine allergy medicine, this is a Waldro brand. And I also take one BC powder or Goody powder because it has caffeine and it gets to the headache really quick. For the eyes, clear eyes or any Visine will help. Also what's helpful when it's allergy season is a neti pot to clear out the right side. What I normally do is I heat up some rice and I put it into a rice pack and you can tell when it's hot. And then I'll put it in a sock of any sort and I use a funnel to put it in. And then once the rice pack is full, I will rest on a couch or another hard surface and apply the heat to the side of my head that hurts the most. And it's always the right side and I think for most cluster headache sufferers, it is the right side. So this is my advice to you to do this whenever you're having an attack. I usually have one probably about an hour after I take a nap or an hour after I try to go to sleep. And most nights I do sleep on the couch when I'm going through my cycles because on the armrest I can turn my head in this fashion. For some reason it relaxes the side of my neck for the carotid artery where most of the pain comes from and generates from. But most of the pain goes up here to this part of my head. So I have to move my head and apply the pressure in different areas with the rice pack to be able to slow it down. And normally I can get it under control within 15 or 30 minutes. And also if you do not want heat, you can massage the areas and apply pressure to where it hurts the most. But again, one half of any type of Red Bull because of the taurine, one diphenhydramine, usually a 25 milligram, and one BC or goody powder in combination. If you're allergic to any of these, please do not do this. And as a supplement, it cuts the root powder and it will help you get through your cycles faster. Thank you for your time.

The headaches can occur like clockwork arriving at almost the same time every day. Men get cluster headaches more than women, and the cause of them is unknown. A cluster headache is always centrally located around the eye. Here are some descriptions of what a cluster headache feels like from people who have experienced them. It's like a burning, hot poker being shoved through your eye while an elephant stands on your temple while someone is punching you in the back of the head and pulling on your hair. Waking out of a sound sleep like somebody hit you in the back of the head with a baseball bat, like my left eyeball is going to explode, crying, moaning, rocking back and forth, praying that it will stop. It feels like my eyeball is in a vise and I have noticed some tautness in the base of my right neck muscles. It's an acute, stabbing pain like a knife behind your eye. It feels like a stabbing pain. I have pain in the jaw, cheek, and neck. The pain is so bad that even touching my hair on my left side hurts. My left sinus cavity is always blocked and I feel I am stuffed up. I've suffered through about 10 episodes of cluster headaches over the past 25 years. Here's the basic nature of my headaches. First I feel a slight burning sensation in my left nostril. There is no other feeling like the burn and it can only be associated with a cluster headache. If you think you are having cluster headaches you must familiarize yourself with what the burn in the nostril feels like in order to be able to take medicine right away. Within a couple of minutes of feeling the burn, a 1-2 second pulsating stab of pain will occur over or behind my left eye. The pulsating pain and the burn start increasing in intensity very quickly. In about 15 minutes my left eye begins to feel as though it is continuously being pinched with tremendous force. My eye begins to stream with tears and my left nostril begins to slightly discharge. If you are to pinch and twist the inside of your arm as hard as you can and then multiply that pain by 3 times, that's what it feels like in the eye. The debilitating pain gradually increases all around the eye and the left side of the head throbs and pulses with stabbing pain as the eye feels like it's being relentlessly pinched. The severe and intense pain doesn't occur in waves but rather it is continuous and it doesn't let up. During a cluster headache attack I cannot move. The only thing I can do is focus on how terrible the pain is. Light sounds and any type of movement are very irritating during these headaches. A cluster headache can last up to an hour and an hour and a half. About medications, Imitrex or Sumitriptan is the only medicine that works. It is vitally important that as soon as you feel the familiar pain in your nostril or eye you must take Imitrex. Cluster headaches always intensify very quickly once the first pain is felt indicating that one is coming on. These headaches are so debilitating that you can never take a chance and wait to take medicine once you feel that familiar pain starting. Within 15 minutes of the first burn in the nostril I've been in an excruciating pain. The only medicine that works effectively for me in stopping the pain or cluster headache is Imitrex. Through the years I've tried Excedrin Migraine, Advil, Tylenol, Aleve, Hydrocodone and several narcotic pain pills. None of them eliminate the pain like Imitrex. I've never found anything over the counter that will stop a cluster headache for up to 8 hours like Imitrex does. Usually over the counter medications take the intense pain away but I am left with an uncomfortable dull ache in the head. Also Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Acetaminophen cause me to have an upset stomach after taking them for a couple of days. Different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumitriptan. Taking the medicine orally. This is the slowest way to get pain relief. A one shot dose of nasal spray. This is about three times quicker than the oral dose. Needle injections are very fast for pain relief."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I've suffered through about 10 episodes of cluster headaches over the past 25 years. Here's the basic nature of my headaches. First I feel a slight burning sensation in my left nostril. There is no other feeling like the burn and it can only be associated with a cluster headache. If you think you are having cluster headaches you must familiarize yourself with what the burn in the nostril feels like in order to be able to take medicine right away. Within a couple of minutes of feeling the burn, a 1-2 second pulsating stab of pain will occur over or behind my left eye. The pulsating pain and the burn start increasing in intensity very quickly. In about 15 minutes my left eye begins to feel as though it is continuously being pinched with tremendous force. My eye begins to stream with tears and my left nostril begins to slightly discharge. If you are to pinch and twist the inside of your arm as hard as you can and then multiply that pain by 3 times, that's what it feels like in the eye. The debilitating pain gradually increases all around the eye and the left side of the head throbs and pulses with stabbing pain as the eye feels like it's being relentlessly pinched. The severe and intense pain doesn't occur in waves but rather it is continuous and it doesn't let up. During a cluster headache attack I cannot move. The only thing I can do is focus on how terrible the pain is. Light sounds and any type of movement are very irritating during these headaches. A cluster headache can last up to an hour and an hour and a half. About medications, Imitrex or Sumitriptan is the only medicine that works. It is vitally important that as soon as you feel the familiar pain in your nostril or eye you must take Imitrex. Cluster headaches always intensify very quickly once the first pain is felt indicating that one is coming on. These headaches are so debilitating that you can never take a chance and wait to take medicine once you feel that familiar pain starting. Within 15 minutes of the first burn in the nostril I've been in an excruciating pain. The only medicine that works effectively for me in stopping the pain or cluster headache is Imitrex. Through the years I've tried Excedrin Migraine, Advil, Tylenol, Aleve, Hydrocodone and several narcotic pain pills. None of them eliminate the pain like Imitrex. I've never found anything over the counter that will stop a cluster headache for up to 8 hours like Imitrex does. Usually over the counter medications take the intense pain away but I am left with an uncomfortable dull ache in the head. Also Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Acetaminophen cause me to have an upset stomach after taking them for a couple of days. Different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumitriptan. Taking the medicine orally. This is the slowest way to get pain relief. A one shot dose of nasal spray. This is about three times quicker than the oral dose. Needle injections are very fast for pain relief."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

In about 15 minutes my left eye begins to feel as though it is continuously being pinched with tremendous force. My eye begins to stream with tears and my left nostril begins to slightly discharge. If you are to pinch and twist the inside of your arm as hard as you can and then multiply that pain by 3 times, that's what it feels like in the eye. The debilitating pain gradually increases all around the eye and the left side of the head throbs and pulses with stabbing pain as the eye feels like it's being relentlessly pinched. The severe and intense pain doesn't occur in waves but rather it is continuous and it doesn't let up. During a cluster headache attack I cannot move. The only thing I can do is focus on how terrible the pain is. Light sounds and any type of movement are very irritating during these headaches. A cluster headache can last up to an hour and an hour and a half. About medications, Imitrex or Sumitriptan is the only medicine that works. It is vitally important that as soon as you feel the familiar pain in your nostril or eye you must take Imitrex. Cluster headaches always intensify very quickly once the first pain is felt indicating that one is coming on. These headaches are so debilitating that you can never take a chance and wait to take medicine once you feel that familiar pain starting. Within 15 minutes of the first burn in the nostril I've been in an excruciating pain. The only medicine that works effectively for me in stopping the pain or cluster headache is Imitrex. Through the years I've tried Excedrin Migraine, Advil, Tylenol, Aleve, Hydrocodone and several narcotic pain pills. None of them eliminate the pain like Imitrex. I've never found anything over the counter that will stop a cluster headache for up to 8 hours like Imitrex does. Usually over the counter medications take the intense pain away but I am left with an uncomfortable dull ache in the head. Also Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Acetaminophen cause me to have an upset stomach after taking them for a couple of days. Different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumitriptan. Taking the medicine orally. This is the slowest way to get pain relief. A one shot dose of nasal spray. This is about three times quicker than the oral dose. Needle injections are very fast for pain relief."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

We were all in a movie theater. I think we were watching Harry Potter. And I started getting a lot of pain and didn't feel very well. So I left toward the end of the movie and went out to the car. When I got to the car, I had what I would call the worst headache of my life. I thought I was having an aneurysm and it just felt like my head was gonna explode. So they came out from the movie and we went right to the emergency room. And from there, they suggested I see a neurologist. So I reached out to the Jefferson Headache Center and signed up to enter their program. And that was a real turning point for me. I got a good diagnosis there almost immediately. And then I went to the Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion. Because at that point, I really had no idea. And I was scared. The pain was intense. And it was very difficult to work, very difficult to attend social functions, etc., to do anything really, with the fear of having an attack in the middle of it. So many people with chronic cluster headaches and some with episodic cluster headaches go through a process of having difficulty at work, not having attendance issues, having performance issues because they're struggling through this thing that nobody really understands. And they sort of go through this spiral of losing a job and then taking another job, losing that job, then losing their health insurance. And then they end up with very little. Why do they call these the suicide headaches? Well, because it takes everything away from you. I think it's not so much the pain, although the pain is horrendous. Living in pain is very difficult. Any chronic pain sufferer can tell you that. But the inability to concentrate, to maintain an activity for an extended period of time beyond, say, 20 minutes, those are things that really steal from you your ability to do things day to day. If I'm completely honest, I've thought about it. You've thought about ending it. Yeah, yeah, I have, on a number of occasions. But then I think about my daughters and my wife and what they bring to me and to some degree what I do for them. And that just changes my thinking. There is definitely a way to live and it can be positive. And I think there's always room to have that downtime and that pity party, but at a certain point, that's not fun anymore. And you have to really think about what you can do and that your life's not the same anymore. It's different. And so how do you reform what you're going to do with your life in this new state?

We were all in a movie theater. I think we were watching Harry Potter. And I started getting a lot of pain and didn't feel very well. So I left toward the end of the movie and went out to the car. When I got to the car, I had what I would call the worst headache of my life. I thought I was having an aneurysm and it just felt like my head was gonna explode. So they came out from the movie and we went right to the emergency room. And from there, they suggested I see a neurologist. So I reached out to the Jefferson Headache Center and signed up to enter their program. And that was a real turning point for me. I got a good diagnosis there almost immediately. And then I went to the Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion. Because at that point, I really had no idea. And I was scared. The pain was intense. And it was very difficult to work, very difficult to attend social functions, etc., to do anything really, with the fear of having an attack in the middle of it.

And they sort of go through this spiral of losing a job and then taking another job, losing that job, then losing their health insurance. And then they end up with very little. Why do they call these the suicide headaches? Well, because it takes everything away from you. I think it's not so much the pain, although the pain is horrendous. Living in pain is very difficult. Any chronic pain sufferer can tell you that. But the inability to concentrate, to maintain an activity for an extended period of time beyond, say, 20 minutes, those are things that really steal from you your ability to do things day to day. If I'm completely honest, I've thought about it. You've thought about ending it. Yeah, yeah, I have, on a number of occasions. But then I think about my daughters and my wife and what they bring to me and to some degree what I do for them. And that just changes my thinking. There is definitely a way to live and it can be positive. And I think there's always room to have that downtime and that pity party, but at a certain point, that's not fun anymore. And you have to really think about what you can do and that your life's not the same anymore. It's different. And so how do you reform what you're going to do with your life in this new state?

In some cases, you can solve this pesky problem by yourselves. Yet sometimes, you should see a doctor immediately. Therefore, we've put together a detailed guide to help you identify five types of headaches and the best ways to get rid of them. Tension headache. This is the most frequent type of headache in the world. Everyone has experienced it at least once in their life. Here are the main symptoms. Tension headaches often cause a pressure that feels like you're wearing a tight band around your forehead. You might feel severe tension and spasms around your eyes and upper forehead. Also, you feel a dull, gnawing pain. Most often, the intensity of the pain increases from morning to evening. What causes this headache? The main factors that seem to contribute to tension headaches are severe stress, fatigue, poor posture, and holding the head in an improper position for a long time. Chronic tension headaches are rare and often are associated with head or neck injuries. How to get rid of it? You can take any appropriate painkiller, but you should only use them occasionally. If headaches occur frequently and last for a long time, consult your doctor. Also, try to be physically active. Stretch your shoulders and neck regularly, and spend more time outdoors. Sinus headache. This type of headache is caused by sinusitis. It is often accompanied by fever, facial swelling, and tension in the forehead and cheekbone. Here are the main symptoms. You'll feel a deep pressure and pain in your forehead, around the eyebrows, and under the eyes. The pain usually gets stronger when you move your head sharply. This headache might also lead to a running or blocked nose. You might feel tired and weak. Sinus headaches are caused by sinusitis. They are also a common complication after a cold or during a seasonal allergy. Keep in mind that sinus headaches rarely go away on their own. If you have an allergy, antihistamines may help. In other cases, it is best to see a doctor who will most probably prescribe antibiotics. Migraine. A migraine is often associated with a violation of the metabolic processes and a dilation of blood vessels in the brain. A person may also inherit the ability to get a migraine. All symptoms of this severe headache occur during a migraine attack that progresses through four main stages. The first is prodrome. It lasts for one to two days. You feel irritable, fatigued, and have an increased or decreased appetite. The second stage, aura. It usually lasts up to 30 minutes. You become sensitive to light, feel tingling and numbness, and might have speech disorders. The third one, resolution, might last up to 24 hours. You feel fatigued and have trouble concentrating on daily tasks. The last stage, the headache itself, might last up to 72 hours, during which you feel severe, throbbing pain. Unfortunately, there's no cure for migraines. Although a number of treatments are available to help ease the symptoms, you need to see your doctor to choose the right one. Moreover, regular exercise will help you improve your health significantly. Cluster headache. Cluster headaches are rare, affecting less than 1% of the population. They are five times more common in males than females. It's hardly possible to confuse this headache with another one. A cluster headache may cause a stabbing pain behind or around your eyes, usually on one side of your head. It frequently develops during sleep. The pain usually lasts from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Symptoms might include redness of the eyes, sensitivity to light, and lacrimation. Scientists don't know exactly what causes cluster headaches. These headaches are most often linked to disruptions in the body's biological clock. Treating it can be tricky, because the pain appears and disappears spontaneously and at a moment's notice. Only a doctor can help you solve this problem. Hangover. We hear many versions of why people often have a headache after drinking alcohol. One of them suggests that alcohol causes blood vessel dilation and affects serotonin levels in your body. Moreover, alcohol promotes water loss and dehydration that are major migraine triggers. The main symptoms are throbbing or dull aching pain, tightness, heaviness. The best remedy is to take a painkiller, drink plenty of water, and get some good sleep. Take a hangover seriously. If you have a headache after consuming even a small amount of alcohol, it may indicate that you're suffering from a mild form of migraine. We hope you never experience any of these headaches. But if you get one of them, it's better to consult a doctor before taking any medication. Do not self-medicate because the consequences can be dire. Thanks for watching!

Moreover, regular exercise will help you improve your health significantly. Cluster headache. Cluster headaches are rare, affecting less than 1% of the population. They are five times more common in males than females. It's hardly possible to confuse this headache with another one. A cluster headache may cause a stabbing pain behind or around your eyes, usually on one side of your head. It frequently develops during sleep. The pain usually lasts from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Symptoms might include redness of the eyes, sensitivity to light, and lacrimation. Scientists don't know exactly what causes cluster headaches. These headaches are most often linked to disruptions in the body's biological clock. Treating it can be tricky, because the pain appears and disappears spontaneously and at a moment's notice. Only a doctor can help you solve this problem. Hangover. We hear many versions of why people often have a headache after drinking alcohol. One of them suggests that alcohol causes blood vessel dilation and affects serotonin levels in your body. Moreover, alcohol promotes water loss and dehydration that are major migraine triggers. The main symptoms are throbbing or dull aching pain, tightness, heaviness. The best remedy is to take a painkiller, drink plenty of water, and get some good sleep. Take a hangover seriously. If you have a headache after consuming even a small amount of alcohol, it may indicate that you're suffering from a mild form of migraine. We hope you never experience any of these headaches. But if you get one of them, it's better to consult a doctor before taking any medication. Do not self-medicate because the consequences can be dire. Thanks for watching!

In some cases, you can solve this pesky problem by yourselves. Yet sometimes, you should see a doctor immediately. Therefore, we've put together a detailed guide to help you identify five types of headaches and the best ways to get rid of them. Tension headache. This is the most frequent type of headache in the world. Everyone has experienced it at least once in their life. Here are the main symptoms. Tension headaches often cause a pressure that feels like you're wearing a tight band around your forehead. You might feel severe tension and spasms around your eyes and upper forehead. Also, you feel a dull, gnawing pain. Most often, the intensity of the pain increases from morning to evening. What causes this headache? The main factors that seem to contribute to tension headaches are severe stress, fatigue, poor posture, and holding the head in an improper position for a long time. Chronic tension headaches are rare and often are associated with head or neck injuries. How to get rid of it? You can take any appropriate painkiller, but you should only use them occasionally. If headaches occur frequently and last for a long time, consult your doctor. Also, try to be physically active. Stretch your shoulders and neck regularly, and spend more time outdoors. Sinus headache. This type of headache is caused by sinusitis. It is often accompanied by fever, facial swelling, and tension in the forehead and cheekbone. Here are the main symptoms. You'll feel a deep pressure and pain in your forehead, around the eyebrows, and under the eyes. The pain usually gets stronger when you move your head sharply. This headache might also lead to a running or blocked nose. You might feel tired and weak. Sinus headaches are caused by sinusitis. They are also a common complication after a cold or during a seasonal allergy. Keep in mind that sinus headaches rarely go away on their own. If you have an allergy, antihistamines may help. In other cases, it is best to see a doctor who will most probably prescribe antibiotics. Migraine. A migraine is often associated with a violation of the metabolic processes and a dilation of blood vessels in the brain. A person may also inherit the ability to get a migraine. All symptoms of this severe headache occur during a migraine attack that progresses through four main stages. The first is prodrome. It lasts for one to two days. You feel irritable, fatigued, and have an increased or decreased appetite. The second stage, aura. It usually lasts up to 30 minutes. You become sensitive to light, feel tingling and numbness, and might have speech disorders. The third one, resolution, might last up to 24 hours. You feel fatigued and have trouble concentrating on daily tasks. The last stage, the headache itself, might last up to 72 hours, during which you feel severe, throbbing pain. Unfortunately, there's no cure for migraines. Although a number of treatments are available to help ease the symptoms, you need to see your doctor to choose the right one.

In some cases, you can solve this pesky problem by yourselves. Yet sometimes, you should see a doctor immediately. Therefore, we've put together a detailed guide to help you identify five types of headaches and the best ways to get rid of them. Tension headache. This is the most frequent type of headache in the world. Everyone has experienced it at least once in their life. Here are the main symptoms. Tension headaches often cause a pressure that feels like you're wearing a tight band around your forehead. You might feel severe tension and spasms around your eyes and upper forehead. Also, you feel a dull, gnawing pain. Most often, the intensity of the pain increases from morning to evening. What causes this headache? The main factors that seem to contribute to tension headaches are severe stress, fatigue, poor posture, and holding the head in an improper position for a long time. Chronic tension headaches are rare and often are associated with head or neck injuries. How to get rid of it? You can take any appropriate painkiller, but you should only use them occasionally. If headaches occur frequently and last for a long time, consult your doctor. Also, try to be physically active. Stretch your shoulders and neck regularly, and spend more time outdoors. Sinus headache. This type of headache is caused by sinusitis. It is often accompanied by fever, facial swelling, and tension in the forehead and cheekbone. Here are the main symptoms. You'll feel a deep pressure and pain in your forehead, around the eyebrows, and under the eyes. The pain usually gets stronger when you move your head sharply. This headache might also lead to a running or blocked nose. You might feel tired and weak. Sinus headaches are caused by sinusitis. They are also a common complication after a cold or during a seasonal allergy. Keep in mind that sinus headaches rarely go away on their own. If you have an allergy, antihistamines may help. In other cases, it is best to see a doctor who will most probably prescribe antibiotics. Migraine. A migraine is often associated with a violation of the metabolic processes and a dilation of blood vessels in the brain. A person may also inherit the ability to get a migraine. All symptoms of this severe headache occur during a migraine attack that progresses through four main stages. The first is prodrome. It lasts for one to two days. You feel irritable, fatigued, and have an increased or decreased appetite. The second stage, aura. It usually lasts up to 30 minutes. You become sensitive to light, feel tingling and numbness, and might have speech disorders. The third one, resolution, might last up to 24 hours. You feel fatigued and have trouble concentrating on daily tasks. The last stage, the headache itself, might last up to 72 hours, during which you feel severe, throbbing pain. Unfortunately, there's no cure for migraines. Although a number of treatments are available to help ease the symptoms, you need to see your doctor to choose the right one. Moreover, regular exercise will help you improve your health significantly. Cluster headache. Cluster headaches are rare, affecting less than 1% of the population. They are five times more common in males than females. It's hardly possible to confuse this headache with another one. A cluster headache may cause a stabbing pain behind or around your eyes, usually on one side of your head. It frequently develops during sleep. The pain usually lasts from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Symptoms might include redness of the eyes, sensitivity to light, and lacrimation. Scientists don't know exactly what causes cluster headaches. These headaches are most often linked to disruptions in the body's biological clock. Treating it can be tricky, because the pain appears and disappears spontaneously and at a moment's notice. Only a doctor can help you solve this problem. Hangover. We hear many versions of why people often have a headache after drinking alcohol. One of them suggests that alcohol causes blood vessel dilation and affects serotonin levels in your body. Moreover, alcohol promotes water loss and dehydration that are major migraine triggers. The main symptoms are throbbing or dull aching pain, tightness, heaviness. The best remedy is to take a painkiller, drink plenty of water, and get some good sleep. Take a hangover seriously. If you have a headache after consuming even a small amount of alcohol, it may indicate that you're suffering from a mild form of migraine. We hope you never experience any of these headaches. But if you get one of them, it's better to consult a doctor before taking any medication. Do not self-medicate because the consequences can be dire. Thanks for watching!

It is one of the most painful experiences that a human can endure. It feels as though somebody is grabbing your inside of your face and pulling as far out and as far wide as they can. Difficult to watch, often unbearable to experience. The pain of a cluster headache can be indescribable. Some sufferers post videos showing an attack to try and convey the reality. We're using these with their permission. Scott has suffered them for 10 years. He helps run a support group, Ouch! UK. I have knocked myself out on various occasions. Because of the pain, I will find something very, very hard to strike my head against. Because you're driven, it's a primeval driver to stop the pain. Cluster headaches baffle doctors. Far more intense than a migraine, many sufferers, like Rachel, experience them when seasons change. I will get mine every spring and every autumn without fail. Rachel's volunteered for a new research project taking place at King's College Hospital in south London. We're looking to see what happens in the brain during the attacks compared to when there is no attack. Around 40 sufferers will have their brains scanned. This is the posterior hypothalamus and it's also known as the internal body clock. We think that is linked with the cluster headache attacks. They tend to have more cluster attacks around spring and autumn. We don't quite understand the reason behind that. This will be an ambitious, at times arduous project. Volunteers will also be having their brains scanned whilst an attack is taking place. Unless people put themselves forward to things like this, we're never going to know any more about cluster headaches. It's estimated there are around 130,000 sufferers in the UK, possibly more as the condition is often misdiagnosed. This patient, who's asked to remain anonymous, is being injected with steroids and an anaesthetic, a preventative measure that can help but is only effective for a few weeks. We're supposed to damp down the activity of the nerves, hence give some relief to these patients. It's hoped this device, which would be implanted inside a patient's head, could offer long-term help. The way it does is by delivering some electricity around the nerve and damping down the hyperactivity, the excessive activation of the nerves, which is firing without any control.

Have you ever had a headache? Of course you have. Who hasn't? Have you ever heard of a suicide headache? There is a medical condition called cluster headache. Researchers have nicknamed it the suicide headache. Cluster headache is the worst pain known to medical science. Here are some sources to validate if you don't take my word for it. HealthBean.com, News.Discovery.com, Alearned.com, NHS.UK, Dr. Peter Godesby and Dr. Todd Rosen. In fact, Google the worst pain known to medical science. A list of cluster headache sites will appear. The pain of a cluster headache attack is said to far surpass that of a migraine headache. Some patients experience both cluster headache attacks and migraine attacks. Some patients describe the pain as worse than childbirth. The first time a sufferer experiences an attack, the result is frightening. Many think they are dying or experiencing a brain tumor. Here are some quotes from patients about their first attack. I was 20 years old and didn't even know pain like that existed. I was absolutely terrified and thought I was going to die. I dialed 911 because I thought my brain was bleeding. Thought I was having a brain aneurysm, bloody terrified. I thought I was dying from an aneurysm and had a panic attack. It felt like demons had burrowed into my head. Proper diagnosis is often difficult to obtain and finding the right treatment is frustrating. Here are some more quotes from patients. I went to the ER and they didn't know what was wrong with me. 59 daily attacks and 6 doctors later, I was finally diagnosed. It took 11 years for my diagnosis. I had cluster headache episodes every 18 months and about my fourth episode, I was diagnosed. The pain induced by a cluster headache attack is so intense, in some cases, even morphine is not enough. Cluster headaches come in cycles. The average is 8 to 12 weeks. However, some cycles have been known to last over a year. During an active cycle, a cluster headache patient can experience up to 8 attacks per day. Each attack lasts between 20 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks are often followed by a dull lingering pain known as the residual headache. During each attack, the patient suffers an immense amount of ongoing, immobilizing pain to one side of the head and behind the eye. While attacks are often clockwork, they come without warning. The frequency and intensity of attacks increases as the cycle progresses. Often times, the sufferer is struck down without a warning. Cycles are vicious and subject to change at any time. Patients live in constant fear that at any moment, they could instantly be struck with the most excruciating pain known to man. Cluster headaches never stop. When a cycle ends, the patient enters a remission period, a pain-free period between cycles, only to await the next impending cycle. Some patients don't get a remission period. Episodic cluster headaches are diagnosed when the patient experiences 1 to 8 attacks daily for weeks on end followed by a remission period. Chronic cluster headaches are diagnosed when a patient experiences multiple attacks for a year or longer with little or no pain-free periods. Chronic patients may have high cycles and low cycles where the frequency and intensity of their attacks fluctuate. Doctors prescribe preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers to their patients. But the pain never goes away. Tryptons are a cluster headache patient's best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Tryptons stop the pain almost immediately after consumption. However, the number of attacks a patient has surpasses the allowed amount of tryptons per month per the FDA. Tryptons can actually prolong a cycle and tolerance to them builds quickly. Treatment is trial and error. There is no cure for cluster headache. There is not a universal treatment that works for every patient. Each cycle is unique to the sufferer. Cluster headache patients have no escape. They often contemplate extreme measures to find relief during an attack, even though relief is an unrealistic expectation during attacks. Continuous treatment failure has led to many cluster headache patients to trial and error of their own with illegal substances just to escape the pain. An anonymous survey revealed many sufferers find relief with hallucinogens and marijuana. Medications only shadow the invading pain temporarily. My name is Jenny McLaren. I am a cluster headache patient. I am a graduate student dedicated to researching and raising awareness of cluster headaches and their effects on patients. Distraction is the best coping mechanism to handle the pain. Here are some coping mechanisms I have used to handle the pain of an attack. Pacing, rocking back and forth, squeezing my hands together tightly, ripping toilet paper rolls to shreds, digging my fingernails into the sides of my arms, applying ice packs, squeezing a stress ball, crying, laying on the kitchen floor rolling from side to side. Here is a list of the treatments my doctors have tried. Maxalt MLT 5 and 10 milligram, Fioricet, Dexamethasone, Tramadol, Scalaxone, Naproxen, Topamax, and Percocet. Cluster headache is an invisible chronic illness. Living with an invisible disease means appearing fine to other people on the outside while actually living in fear and pain. This causes a negative stigma about you which can lead to strains on relationships. This is one reason cluster headache patients are at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, panic attacks than their pain-free counterparts. Between 2005 and 2009, a study was conducted to investigate whether cluster headache was a risk factor for depression. A group of cluster headache patients were monitored along with two other groups, migraine sufferers and patients free from cluster headaches or migraines. The results of the study showed that cluster headache patients had a significantly higher risk for depression than the other two cohorts. 1,134 individuals completed the survey. Suicidal ideations were substantial occurring in 55% of patients. The same survey explored the personal burden of cluster headaches. 20% of cluster headache patients have lost a job secondary to cluster headache while another 8% are out of work or on disability secondary to their headaches. Cluster headache patients are more susceptible to a wide range of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disorders and adjustment disorders than their pain-free counterparts. While cluster headaches induce feelings of hopelessness, everyone can help by spreading awareness and educating others about cluster headaches. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage. We can fight the fear of impending attacks together through advocacy and support. Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me?"}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

HealthBean.com, News.Discovery.com, Alearned.com, NHS.UK, Dr. Peter Godesby and Dr. Todd Rosen. In fact, Google the worst pain known to medical science. A list of cluster headache sites will appear. The pain of a cluster headache attack is said to far surpass that of a migraine headache. Some patients experience both cluster headache attacks and migraine attacks. Some patients describe the pain as worse than childbirth. The first time a sufferer experiences an attack, the result is frightening. Many think they are dying or experiencing a brain tumor. Here are some quotes from patients about their first attack. I was 20 years old and didn't even know pain like that existed. I was absolutely terrified and thought I was going to die. I dialed 911 because I thought my brain was bleeding. Thought I was having a brain aneurysm, bloody terrified. I thought I was dying from an aneurysm and had a panic attack. It felt like demons had burrowed into my head. Proper diagnosis is often difficult to obtain and finding the right treatment is frustrating. Here are some more quotes from patients. I went to the ER and they didn't know what was wrong with me. 59 daily attacks and 6 doctors later, I was finally diagnosed. It took 11 years for my diagnosis. I had cluster headache episodes every 18 months and about my fourth episode, I was diagnosed. The pain induced by a cluster headache attack is so intense, in some cases, even morphine is not enough. Cluster headaches come in cycles. The average is 8 to 12 weeks. However, some cycles have been known to last over a year. During an active cycle, a cluster headache patient can experience up to 8 attacks per day. Each attack lasts between 20 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks are often followed by a dull lingering pain known as the residual headache. During each attack, the patient suffers an immense amount of ongoing, immobilizing pain to one side of the head and behind the eye. While attacks are often clockwork, they come without warning. The frequency and intensity of attacks increases as the cycle progresses. Often times, the sufferer is struck down without a warning. Cycles are vicious and subject to change at any time. Patients live in constant fear that at any moment, they could instantly be struck with the most excruciating pain known to man. Cluster headaches never stop. When a cycle ends, the patient enters a remission period, a pain-free period between cycles, only to await the next impending cycle. Some patients don't get a remission period. Episodic cluster headaches are diagnosed when the patient experiences 1 to 8 attacks daily for weeks on end followed by a remission period. Chronic cluster headaches are diagnosed when a patient experiences multiple attacks for a year or longer with little or no pain-free periods. Chronic patients may have high cycles and low cycles where the frequency and intensity of their attacks fluctuate. Doctors prescribe preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers to their patients. But the pain never goes away. Tryptons are a cluster headache patient's best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Tryptons stop the pain almost immediately after consumption. However, the number of attacks a patient has surpasses the allowed amount of tryptons per month per the FDA. Tryptons can actually prolong a cycle and tolerance to them builds quickly. Treatment is trial and error. There is no cure for cluster headache. There is not a universal treatment that works for every patient. Each cycle is unique to the sufferer. Cluster headache patients have no escape. They often contemplate extreme measures to find relief during an attack, even though relief is an unrealistic expectation during attacks. Continuous treatment failure has led to many cluster headache patients to trial and error of their own with illegal substances just to escape the pain. An anonymous survey revealed many sufferers find relief with hallucinogens and marijuana. Medications only shadow the invading pain temporarily. My name is Jenny McLaren. I am a cluster headache patient. I am a graduate student dedicated to researching and raising awareness of cluster headaches and their effects on patients. Distraction is the best coping mechanism to handle the pain. Here are some coping mechanisms I have used to handle the pain of an attack. Pacing, rocking back and forth, squeezing my hands together tightly, ripping toilet paper rolls to shreds, digging my fingernails into the sides of my arms, applying ice packs, squeezing a stress ball, crying, laying on the kitchen floor rolling from side to side. Here is a list of the treatments my doctors have tried. Maxalt MLT 5 and 10 milligram, Fioricet, Dexamethasone, Tramadol, Scalaxone, Naproxen, Topamax, and Percocet. Cluster headache is an invisible chronic illness. Living with an invisible disease means appearing fine to other people on the outside while actually living in fear and pain. This causes a negative stigma about you which can lead to strains on relationships. This is one reason cluster headache patients are at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, panic attacks than their pain-free counterparts. Between 2005 and 2009, a study was conducted to investigate whether cluster headache was a risk factor for depression. A group of cluster headache patients were monitored along with two other groups, migraine sufferers and patients free from cluster headaches or migraines. The results of the study showed that cluster headache patients had a significantly higher risk for depression than the other two cohorts. 1,134 individuals completed the survey. Suicidal ideations were substantial occurring in 55% of patients. The same survey explored the personal burden of cluster headaches. 20% of cluster headache patients have lost a job secondary to cluster headache while another 8% are out of work or on disability secondary to their headaches. Cluster headache patients are more susceptible to a wide range of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disorders and adjustment disorders than their pain-free counterparts. While cluster headaches induce feelings of hopelessness, everyone can help by spreading awareness and educating others about cluster headaches. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage. We can fight the fear of impending attacks together through advocacy and support. Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me?"}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Have you ever had a headache? Of course you have. Who hasn't? Have you ever heard of a suicide headache? There is a medical condition called cluster headache. Researchers have nicknamed it the suicide headache. Cluster headache is the worst pain known to medical science. Here are some sources to validate if you don't take my word for it. HealthBean.com, News.Discovery.com, Alearned.com, NHS.UK, Dr. Peter Godesby and Dr. Todd Rosen. In fact, Google the worst pain known to medical science. A list of cluster headache sites will appear. The pain of a cluster headache attack is said to far surpass that of a migraine headache. Some patients experience both cluster headache attacks and migraine attacks. Some patients describe the pain as worse than childbirth. The first time a sufferer experiences an attack, the result is frightening. Many think they are dying or experiencing a brain tumor. Here are some quotes from patients about their first attack. I was 20 years old and didn't even know pain like that existed. I was absolutely terrified and thought I was going to die. I dialed 911 because I thought my brain was bleeding. Thought I was having a brain aneurysm, bloody terrified. I thought I was dying from an aneurysm and had a panic attack. It felt like demons had burrowed into my head. Proper diagnosis is often difficult to obtain and finding the right treatment is frustrating. Here are some more quotes from patients. I went to the ER and they didn't know what was wrong with me. 59 daily attacks and 6 doctors later, I was finally diagnosed. It took 11 years for my diagnosis. I had cluster headache episodes every 18 months and about my fourth episode, I was diagnosed. The pain induced by a cluster headache attack is so intense, in some cases, even morphine is not enough. Cluster headaches come in cycles. The average is 8 to 12 weeks. However, some cycles have been known to last over a year. During an active cycle, a cluster headache patient can experience up to 8 attacks per day. Each attack lasts between 20 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks are often followed by a dull lingering pain known as the residual headache. During each attack, the patient suffers an immense amount of ongoing, immobilizing pain to one side of the head and behind the eye. While attacks are often clockwork, they come without warning. The frequency and intensity of attacks increases as the cycle progresses. Often times, the sufferer is struck down without a warning. Cycles are vicious and subject to change at any time. Patients live in constant fear that at any moment, they could instantly be struck with the most excruciating pain known to man. Cluster headaches never stop. When a cycle ends, the patient enters a remission period, a pain-free period between cycles, only to await the next impending cycle. Some patients don't get a remission period. Episodic cluster headaches are diagnosed when the patient experiences 1 to 8 attacks daily for weeks on end followed by a remission period. Chronic cluster headaches are diagnosed when a patient experiences multiple attacks for a year or longer with little or no pain-free periods. Chronic patients may have high cycles and low cycles where the frequency and intensity of their attacks fluctuate. Doctors prescribe preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers to their patients. But the pain never goes away. Tryptons are a cluster headache patient's best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Tryptons stop the pain almost immediately after consumption. However, the number of attacks a patient has surpasses the allowed amount of tryptons per month per the FDA. Tryptons can actually prolong a cycle and tolerance to them builds quickly. Treatment is trial and error. There is no cure for cluster headache. There is not a universal treatment that works for every patient. Each cycle is unique to the sufferer. Cluster headache patients have no escape. They often contemplate extreme measures to find relief during an attack, even though relief is an unrealistic expectation during attacks. Continuous treatment failure has led to many cluster headache patients to trial and error of their own with illegal substances just to escape the pain. An anonymous survey revealed many sufferers find relief with hallucinogens and marijuana. Medications only shadow the invading pain temporarily. My name is Jenny McLaren. I am a cluster headache patient. I am a graduate student dedicated to researching and raising awareness of cluster headaches and their effects on patients. Distraction is the best coping mechanism to handle the pain. Here are some coping mechanisms I have used to handle the pain of an attack. Pacing, rocking back and forth, squeezing my hands together tightly, ripping toilet paper rolls to shreds, digging my fingernails into the sides of my arms, applying ice packs, squeezing a stress ball, crying, laying on the kitchen floor rolling from side to side. Here is a list of the treatments my doctors have tried. Maxalt MLT 5 and 10 milligram, Fioricet, Dexamethasone, Tramadol, Scalaxone, Naproxen, Topamax, and Percocet. Cluster headache is an invisible chronic illness. Living with an invisible disease means appearing fine to other people on the outside while actually living in fear and pain. This causes a negative stigma about you which can lead to strains on relationships. This is one reason cluster headache patients are at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, panic attacks than their pain-free counterparts. Between 2005 and 2009, a study was conducted to investigate whether cluster headache was a risk factor for depression. A group of cluster headache patients were monitored along with two other groups, migraine sufferers and patients free from cluster headaches or migraines. The results of the study showed that cluster headache patients had a significantly higher risk for depression than the other two cohorts. 1,134 individuals completed the survey. Suicidal ideations were substantial occurring in 55% of patients. The same survey explored the personal burden of cluster headaches. 20% of cluster headache patients have lost a job secondary to cluster headache while another 8% are out of work or on disability secondary to their headaches. Cluster headache patients are more susceptible to a wide range of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disorders and adjustment disorders than their pain-free counterparts. While cluster headaches induce feelings of hopelessness, everyone can help by spreading awareness and educating others about cluster headaches. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.

Have you ever had a headache? Of course you have. Who hasn't? Have you ever heard of a suicide headache? There is a medical condition called cluster headache. Researchers have nicknamed it the suicide headache. Cluster headache is the worst pain known to medical science. Here are some sources to validate if you don't take my word for it. HealthBean.com, News.Discovery.com, Alearned.com, NHS.UK, Dr. Peter Godesby and Dr. Todd Rosen. In fact, Google the worst pain known to medical science. A list of cluster headache sites will appear. The pain of a cluster headache attack is said to far surpass that of a migraine headache. Some patients experience both cluster headache attacks and migraine attacks. Some patients describe the pain as worse than childbirth. The first time a sufferer experiences an attack, the result is frightening. Many think they are dying or experiencing a brain tumor. Here are some quotes from patients about their first attack. I was 20 years old and didn't even know pain like that existed. I was absolutely terrified and thought I was going to die. I dialed 911 because I thought my brain was bleeding. Thought I was having a brain aneurysm, bloody terrified. I thought I was dying from an aneurysm and had a panic attack. It felt like demons had burrowed into my head. Proper diagnosis is often difficult to obtain and finding the right treatment is frustrating. Here are some more quotes from patients. I went to the ER and they didn't know what was wrong with me. 59 daily attacks and 6 doctors later, I was finally diagnosed. It took 11 years for my diagnosis. I had cluster headache episodes every 18 months and about my fourth episode, I was diagnosed. The pain induced by a cluster headache attack is so intense, in some cases, even morphine is not enough. Cluster headaches come in cycles. The average is 8 to 12 weeks. However, some cycles have been known to last over a year. During an active cycle, a cluster headache patient can experience up to 8 attacks per day. Each attack lasts between 20 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks are often followed by a dull lingering pain known as the residual headache. During each attack, the patient suffers an immense amount of ongoing, immobilizing pain to one side of the head and behind the eye. While attacks are often clockwork, they come without warning. The frequency and intensity of attacks increases as the cycle progresses. Often times, the sufferer is struck down without a warning. Cycles are vicious and subject to change at any time. Patients live in constant fear that at any moment, they could instantly be struck with the most excruciating pain known to man. Cluster headaches never stop. When a cycle ends, the patient enters a remission period, a pain-free period between cycles, only to await the next impending cycle. Some patients don't get a remission period. Episodic cluster headaches are diagnosed when the patient experiences 1 to 8 attacks daily for weeks on end followed by a remission period. Chronic cluster headaches are diagnosed when a patient experiences multiple attacks for a year or longer with little or no pain-free periods. Chronic patients may have high cycles and low cycles where the frequency and intensity of their attacks fluctuate. Doctors prescribe preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers to their patients. But the pain never goes away. Tryptons are a cluster headache patient's best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Tryptons stop the pain almost immediately after consumption. However, the number of attacks a patient has surpasses the allowed amount of tryptons per month per the FDA. Tryptons can actually prolong a cycle and tolerance to them builds quickly. Treatment is trial and error. There is no cure for cluster headache. There is not a universal treatment that works for every patient. Each cycle is unique to the sufferer. Cluster headache patients have no escape. They often contemplate extreme measures to find relief during an attack, even though relief is an unrealistic expectation during attacks. Continuous treatment failure has led to many cluster headache patients to trial and error of their own with illegal substances just to escape the pain. An anonymous survey revealed many sufferers find relief with hallucinogens and marijuana. Medications only shadow the invading pain temporarily. My name is Jenny McLaren. I am a cluster headache patient. I am a graduate student dedicated to researching and raising awareness of cluster headaches and their effects on patients. Distraction is the best coping mechanism to handle the pain. Here are some coping mechanisms I have used to handle the pain of an attack. Pacing, rocking back and forth, squeezing my hands together tightly, ripping toilet paper rolls to shreds, digging my fingernails into the sides of my arms, applying ice packs, squeezing a stress ball, crying, laying on the kitchen floor rolling from side to side. Here is a list of the treatments my doctors have tried. Maxalt MLT 5 and 10 milligram, Fioricet, Dexamethasone, Tramadol, Scalaxone, Naproxen, Topamax, and Percocet. Cluster headache is an invisible chronic illness. Living with an invisible disease means appearing fine to other people on the outside while actually living in fear and pain. This causes a negative stigma about you which can lead to strains on relationships. This is one reason cluster headache patients are at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, panic attacks than their pain-free counterparts. Between 2005 and 2009, a study was conducted to investigate whether cluster headache was a risk factor for depression. A group of cluster headache patients were monitored along with two other groups, migraine sufferers and patients free from cluster headaches or migraines. The results of the study showed that cluster headache patients had a significantly higher risk for depression than the other two cohorts. 1,134 individuals completed the survey. Suicidal ideations were substantial occurring in 55% of patients. The same survey explored the personal burden of cluster headaches. 20% of cluster headache patients have lost a job secondary to cluster headache while another 8% are out of work or on disability secondary to their headaches. Cluster headache patients are more susceptible to a wide range of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disorders and adjustment disorders than their pain-free counterparts. While cluster headaches induce feelings of hopelessness, everyone can help by spreading awareness and educating others about cluster headaches. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.
