The next morning my wife got a phone call. They said that there were signs of spina bifida. We were told if we didn't have an intervention she would be paralyzed from the knees down, possibly the waist down. Also could cause being catheterized her life, possibly being in a wheelchair with it, have a brain shunt. I mean there was just so much different things and for me as a mom it wasn't necessarily what it would mean to our family. It was just how do you protect her? How do you let her live a normal life? It's like time stopped. You just, you have so many unknowns and unknown questions and to know that you're a child there's something wrong. My husband was, we will do whatever we have to do. We will go wherever we have to go to give our kid the best options. We started doing research with programs around the country in Boston and Philadelphia. There's only approximately 4,000 kids a year born with spina bifida. We just wanted to get the best program available. You know that you're going to be this family's point person in a very, very stressful time in their life. You're just not expecting anything to be wrong and then you get hit with this, you know. So it's very emotional for them. You go from them from the time they find out they have a fetal anomaly in their 18, 20 week ultrasound until the time they get to go home with that baby and it's just, it's so rewarding to be a part of that. The next day I received a call that morning from Carol. She explained everything to me, answered every question. The main one was one of the options you have is to operate on your baby before it's even born. I had no idea that you could go into a woman's womb and operate on a fetus and especially, especially to the magnitude that this is. For certain patients there's the chance of significant benefit for fetal surgery. In their case the legs were still strong and the lesion was in the middle of the back. So in those cases if you can close the back in the second trimester you can protect those nerves and preserve function. By doing the fetal surgery we found that you can reduce by half the number of babies that need this shunt. So avoidance of this shunt, avoidance of the hydrocephalus is the number one goal of this kind of fetuscopic surgery. The second goal is to try and preserve as much nerve function as possible. The longer that the nerves are exposed to the amniotic fluid the greater the degree of damage to those nerves. The earlier we can cover up those nerves with a skin covering and prevent their exposure to amniotic fluid the more of the function of those nerves we can save. For us we had to do whatever we could given that she had motor function movement in her feet and her legs. We couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't give her that chance. I think when we were finished Dr. Belfort said we were the 23rd successful two port fetuscopic surgery in the history of the United States and that's just, I still don't fathom that. There isn't much that we haven't seen and there's a lot that we can offer in terms of treatments and therapy to try to minimize the effects of spina bifida. This kind of work needs to be done in a very collaborative, multidisciplinary way. It is not simply getting the surgery. There's got to be neurosurgery input, neonatal intensive care input, the radiology, the diagnostics involved are critically important. The way that the neonatologists and the obstetricians and the pediatric surgeons work together is critically important. It is a team effort. Texas Children's has all of that and has it down and it's world renowned for that. We've done more than anybody in the United States and we developed the two port procedure right here. The results of our procedure at the moment in terms of the gestational age at delivery are the best in the world, no question. So the day of delivery, the family was in the room, we were in the room, the emotions were there, the happiness was there, the joy was there. As of now she's a little over nine months old. She has full movement of her legs, feet, toes. We've had no issue with hydrocephalus at this point. She's a normal baby to us. You can't tell by looking at her or how she acts or any of her motor skills or functions that anything's wrong. A year and two months ago when we got the news, this is not where I seen me. I did not see that I would have a nine month old that is sitting up on her own that is going backwards, she's going in circles, she's not quite crawling yet but she's almost there. I never thought at this point that I would see the day with no orthopedics or anything that my daughter could stand on her own. Texas Children's is who we thank for that. Without this fetal team, our daughter would not be where she is today. We will forever be grateful to them. We can't say thank you enough. Thank you just sounds so meaningless. Words can't express our gratitude and our thanks for the blessings that they've given us with our child. We couldn't ask for anything more."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

You know that you're going to be this family's point person in a very, very stressful time in their life. You're just not expecting anything to be wrong and then you get hit with this, you know. So it's very emotional for them. You go from them from the time they find out they have a fetal anomaly in their 18, 20 week ultrasound until the time they get to go home with that baby and it's just, it's so rewarding to be a part of that. The next day I received a call that morning from Carol. She explained everything to me, answered every question. The main one was one of the options you have is to operate on your baby before it's even born. I had no idea that you could go into a woman's womb and operate on a fetus and especially, especially to the magnitude that this is. For certain patients there's the chance of significant benefit for fetal surgery. In their case the legs were still strong and the lesion was in the middle of the back. So in those cases if you can close the back in the second trimester you can protect those nerves and preserve function. By doing the fetal surgery we found that you can reduce by half the number of babies that need this shunt. So avoidance of this shunt, avoidance of the hydrocephalus is the number one goal of this kind of fetuscopic surgery. The second goal is to try and preserve as much nerve function as possible. The longer that the nerves are exposed to the amniotic fluid the greater the degree of damage to those nerves. The earlier we can cover up those nerves with a skin covering and prevent their exposure to amniotic fluid the more of the function of those nerves we can save. For us we had to do whatever we could given that she had motor function movement in her feet and her legs. We couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't give her that chance. I think when we were finished Dr. Belfort said we were the 23rd successful two port fetuscopic surgery in the history of the United States and that's just, I still don't fathom that. There isn't much that we haven't seen and there's a lot that we can offer in terms of treatments and therapy to try to minimize the effects of spina bifida. This kind of work needs to be done in a very collaborative, multidisciplinary way. It is not simply getting the surgery. There's got to be neurosurgery input, neonatal intensive care input, the radiology, the diagnostics involved are critically important. The way that the neonatologists and the obstetricians and the pediatric surgeons work together is critically important. It is a team effort. Texas Children's has all of that and has it down and it's world renowned for that. We've done more than anybody in the United States and we developed the two port procedure right here. The results of our procedure at the moment in terms of the gestational age at delivery are the best in the world, no question. So the day of delivery, the family was in the room, we were in the room, the emotions were there, the happiness was there, the joy was there. As of now she's a little over nine months old. She has full movement of her legs, feet, toes. We've had no issue with hydrocephalus at this point. She's a normal baby to us. You can't tell by looking at her or how she acts or any of her motor skills or functions that anything's wrong. A year and two months ago when we got the news, this is not where I seen me. I did not see that I would have a nine month old that is sitting up on her own that is going backwards, she's going in circles, she's not quite crawling yet but she's almost there. I never thought at this point that I would see the day with no orthopedics or anything that my daughter could stand on her own. Texas Children's is who we thank for that. Without this fetal team, our daughter would not be where she is today. We will forever be grateful to them. We can't say thank you enough. Thank you just sounds so meaningless. Words can't express our gratitude and our thanks for the blessings that they've given us with our child. We couldn't ask for anything more."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

The next morning my wife got a phone call. They said that there were signs of spina bifida. We were told if we didn't have an intervention she would be paralyzed from the knees down, possibly the waist down. Also could cause being catheterized her life, possibly being in a wheelchair with it, have a brain shunt. I mean there was just so much different things and for me as a mom it wasn't necessarily what it would mean to our family. It was just how do you protect her? How do you let her live a normal life? It's like time stopped. You just, you have so many unknowns and unknown questions and to know that you're a child there's something wrong. My husband was, we will do whatever we have to do. We will go wherever we have to go to give our kid the best options. We started doing research with programs around the country in Boston and Philadelphia. There's only approximately 4,000 kids a year born with spina bifida. We just wanted to get the best program available. You know that you're going to be this family's point person in a very, very stressful time in their life. You're just not expecting anything to be wrong and then you get hit with this, you know. So it's very emotional for them. You go from them from the time they find out they have a fetal anomaly in their 18, 20 week ultrasound until the time they get to go home with that baby and it's just, it's so rewarding to be a part of that. The next day I received a call that morning from Carol. She explained everything to me, answered every question. The main one was one of the options you have is to operate on your baby before it's even born. I had no idea that you could go into a woman's womb and operate on a fetus and especially, especially to the magnitude that this is. For certain patients there's the chance of significant benefit for fetal surgery. In their case the legs were still strong and the lesion was in the middle of the back. So in those cases if you can close the back in the second trimester you can protect those nerves and preserve function. By doing the fetal surgery we found that you can reduce by half the number of babies that need this shunt. So avoidance of this shunt, avoidance of the hydrocephalus is the number one goal of this kind of fetuscopic surgery. The second goal is to try and preserve as much nerve function as possible. The longer that the nerves are exposed to the amniotic fluid the greater the degree of damage to those nerves. The earlier we can cover up those nerves with a skin covering and prevent their exposure to amniotic fluid the more of the function of those nerves we can save. For us we had to do whatever we could given that she had motor function movement in her feet and her legs. We couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't give her that chance. I think when we were finished Dr. Belfort said we were the 23rd successful two port fetuscopic surgery in the history of the United States and that's just, I still don't fathom that. There isn't much that we haven't seen and there's a lot that we can offer in terms of treatments and therapy to try to minimize the effects of spina bifida. This kind of work needs to be done in a very collaborative, multidisciplinary way. It is not simply getting the surgery. There's got to be neurosurgery input, neonatal intensive care input, the radiology, the diagnostics involved are critically important. The way that the neonatologists and the obstetricians and the pediatric surgeons work together is critically important. It is a team effort. Texas Children's has all of that and has it down and it's world renowned for that. We've done more than anybody in the United States and we developed the two port procedure right here. The results of our procedure at the moment in terms of the gestational age at delivery are the best in the world, no question. So the day of delivery, the family was in the room, we were in the room, the emotions were there, the happiness was there, the joy was there. As of now she's a little over nine months old. She has full movement of her legs, feet, toes. We've had no issue with hydrocephalus at this point. She's a normal baby to us. You can't tell by looking at her or how she acts or any of her motor skills or functions that anything's wrong. A year and two months ago when we got the news, this is not where I seen me. I did not see that I would have a nine month old that is sitting up on her own that is going backwards, she's going in circles, she's not quite crawling yet but she's almost there. I never thought at this point that I would see the day with no orthopedics or anything that my daughter could stand on her own. Texas Children's is who we thank for that. Without this fetal team, our daughter would not be where she is today. We will forever be grateful to them. We can't say thank you enough. Thank you just sounds so meaningless.

So the day of delivery, the family was in the room, we were in the room, the emotions were there, the happiness was there, the joy was there. As of now she's a little over nine months old. She has full movement of her legs, feet, toes. We've had no issue with hydrocephalus at this point. She's a normal baby to us. You can't tell by looking at her or how she acts or any of her motor skills or functions that anything's wrong. A year and two months ago when we got the news, this is not where I seen me. I did not see that I would have a nine month old that is sitting up on her own that is going backwards, she's going in circles, she's not quite crawling yet but she's almost there. I never thought at this point that I would see the day with no orthopedics or anything that my daughter could stand on her own. Texas Children's is who we thank for that.

The next morning my wife got a phone call. They said that there were signs of spina bifida. We were told if we didn't have an intervention she would be paralyzed from the knees down, possibly the waist down. Also could cause being catheterized her life, possibly being in a wheelchair with it, have a brain shunt. I mean there was just so much different things and for me as a mom it wasn't necessarily what it would mean to our family. It was just how do you protect her? How do you let her live a normal life? It's like time stopped. You just, you have so many unknowns and unknown questions and to know that you're a child there's something wrong. My husband was, we will do whatever we have to do. We will go wherever we have to go to give our kid the best options. We started doing research with programs around the country in Boston and Philadelphia. There's only approximately 4,000 kids a year born with spina bifida. We just wanted to get the best program available. You know that you're going to be this family's point person in a very, very stressful time in their life. You're just not expecting anything to be wrong and then you get hit with this, you know. So it's very emotional for them. You go from them from the time they find out they have a fetal anomaly in their 18, 20 week ultrasound until the time they get to go home with that baby and it's just, it's so rewarding to be a part of that. The next day I received a call that morning from Carol. She explained everything to me, answered every question. The main one was one of the options you have is to operate on your baby before it's even born. I had no idea that you could go into a woman's womb and operate on a fetus and especially, especially to the magnitude that this is. For certain patients there's the chance of significant benefit for fetal surgery. In their case the legs were still strong and the lesion was in the middle of the back. So in those cases if you can close the back in the second trimester you can protect those nerves and preserve function. By doing the fetal surgery we found that you can reduce by half the number of babies that need this shunt. So avoidance of this shunt, avoidance of the hydrocephalus is the number one goal of this kind of fetuscopic surgery. The second goal is to try and preserve as much nerve function as possible. The longer that the nerves are exposed to the amniotic fluid the greater the degree of damage to those nerves. The earlier we can cover up those nerves with a skin covering and prevent their exposure to amniotic fluid the more of the function of those nerves we can save. For us we had to do whatever we could given that she had motor function movement in her feet and her legs. We couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't give her that chance. I think when we were finished Dr. Belfort said we were the 23rd successful two port fetuscopic surgery in the history of the United States and that's just, I still don't fathom that. There isn't much that we haven't seen and there's a lot that we can offer in terms of treatments and therapy to try to minimize the effects of spina bifida.

The surgery is performed by opening the mother's abdomen and exposing the uterus. Stitches are placed to secure the membranes to the uterine wall. A small plastic port about the size of a pencil is inserted. The amniotic fluid is removed and a safe amount of warm carbon dioxide gas is used to create a dry working space. The baby's position is adjusted as needed. A second port is placed using the same process as the first one. Next, the exposed portion of the spinal cord is released. In order to perform a layered closure, a portion of the muscle is released on both sides. This is similar to the process used in open fetal surgery and surgeries performed after birth. A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back.

The surgery is performed by opening the mother's abdomen and exposing the uterus. Stitches are placed to secure the membranes to the uterine wall. A small plastic port about the size of a pencil is inserted. The amniotic fluid is removed and a safe amount of warm carbon dioxide gas is used to create a dry working space. The baby's position is adjusted as needed. A second port is placed using the same process as the first one. Next, the exposed portion of the spinal cord is released. In order to perform a layered closure, a portion of the muscle is released on both sides. This is similar to the process used in open fetal surgery and surgeries performed after birth. A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back. Lastly, the fluid is replaced, port's removed, and the abdomen is closed. The pregnancy is monitored closely and vaginal delivery at term is possible.

All the components of our rather large team meet to discuss the case and then have the parents come in and we go through the entire process once again so that there's a clear understanding of what's involved and give them the opportunity to ask any additional questions. We had to be down here, I don't know if it was five o'clock or six o'clock, but it was very early in the morning. I was so nervous. And you know, still a lot of consultations and things like that going on and you know. Flurry of activity. They put an epidural in was the first thing they were going to do and I had to be awake for that. You are knocked out for the surgery. I remember bending over getting that epidural and they're talking to me and all of a sudden you go, oh, I mean if it hadn't hit us already, it hit me then. This is big time. Seventeen days before that, life was normal and all of a sudden here we are. We're doing fetal surgery for something that's cutting edge. We have a special OR that we use for fetal surgery. It's a very large OR because there's a lot of equipment that's there and there are a lot of people involved in this. There are a couple of anesthesiologists. There's the fetal team. Two to three surgeons in the room. There's a cardiologist in the room who monitors the baby's heart through the entire procedure. There's a neurosurgeon who actually does the myelomeningocele repair. There's an obstetrician or maternal fetal medicine specialist in the room who monitors the mother's uterus and performs ultrasound so that we make sure we put the incision in the uterus where we need to put it. And it all has to be carefully choreographed so that everybody is focused on what their role is, what they need to do, but everybody has to work seamlessly together. The mother goes under deep general anesthesia. General anesthesia is important for at least three reasons. It anesthetizes the mother, anesthetizes the fetus, and also gives us very good uterine relaxation, relaxation of the uterine muscle, which is very important for the operation. An ultrasound is done to look at the fetal position and then a sideways wound is made, almost hip bone to hip bone, halfway between the belly button and the pubic bone to expose the uterus. Oft times the obstetrician will move the fetus within the uterus so that the myelomeningocele or spina bifida lesion is right underneath where we're going to make the cut in the uterus because the baby basically stays inside the uterus during the operation. The cut in the uterus is done again under ultrasound guidance, sterile intraoperative ultrasound guidance with a uterine stapling device that fires absorbable staples that pinch off all the blood vessels and keep the membranes around the baby tacked up to the muscle layer of the uterus. During the operation, the fetal cardiologist does monitoring of the fetal heart by echocardiography. We're able to look at blood flow patterns through the heart, the various structures and the flow towards the different organs, heart function. We look at the heart rate. We're able to feed that information back to the surgeons and to the anesthesiologist that's managing the mother. The neurosurgeon then comes in and he and I do the myelomeningocele repair exactly like you would do in a newborn after birth. I trim the sac of abnormal skin away from the nerve tissue. It's important to do that because that skin tissue, if I leave it behind, can become a cyst. There can be a problem later on. We then put the nerve tissue back into the spinal canal where it's supposed to be and then I try to get a three-layer closure. First layer is the dura. That's the normal covering of the brain and the spinal cord. The second layer is the fascia. That's kind of like muscle-type tissue. And then the third layer is the skin. The goal is to cover the unprotected spinal cord so that it's a watertight protective closure. It needs to be watertight for two reasons. One is that you want to stop the damage caused by amniotic fluid exposure for the rest of the pregnancy. And you also want to stop the leakage of cerebral spinal fluid out through the back that plays an important role in the development of hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. So if you stop the leak back here, the hindbrain can go back and the hydrocephalus is less of an issue. Once the uterine wound is closed, the maternal abdomen is closed, including the skin with a plastic surgical closure. All the layers are closed with an absorbable stitch that will dissolve once the mother's wound is healed."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

And you know, still a lot of consultations and things like that going on and you know. Flurry of activity. They put an epidural in was the first thing they were going to do and I had to be awake for that. You are knocked out for the surgery. I remember bending over getting that epidural and they're talking to me and all of a sudden you go, oh, I mean if it hadn't hit us already, it hit me then. This is big time. Seventeen days before that, life was normal and all of a sudden here we are. We're doing fetal surgery for something that's cutting edge. We have a special OR that we use for fetal surgery. It's a very large OR because there's a lot of equipment that's there and there are a lot of people involved in this. There are a couple of anesthesiologists. There's the fetal team. Two to three surgeons in the room. There's a cardiologist in the room who monitors the baby's heart through the entire procedure. There's a neurosurgeon who actually does the myelomeningocele repair. There's an obstetrician or maternal fetal medicine specialist in the room who monitors the mother's uterus and performs ultrasound so that we make sure we put the incision in the uterus where we need to put it. And it all has to be carefully choreographed so that everybody is focused on what their role is, what they need to do, but everybody has to work seamlessly together. The mother goes under deep general anesthesia. General anesthesia is important for at least three reasons. It anesthetizes the mother, anesthetizes the fetus, and also gives us very good uterine relaxation, relaxation of the uterine muscle, which is very important for the operation. An ultrasound is done to look at the fetal position and then a sideways wound is made, almost hip bone to hip bone, halfway between the belly button and the pubic bone to expose the uterus. Oft times the obstetrician will move the fetus within the uterus so that the myelomeningocele or spina bifida lesion is right underneath where we're going to make the cut in the uterus because the baby basically stays inside the uterus during the operation. The cut in the uterus is done again under ultrasound guidance, sterile intraoperative ultrasound guidance with a uterine stapling device that fires absorbable staples that pinch off all the blood vessels and keep the membranes around the baby tacked up to the muscle layer of the uterus. During the operation, the fetal cardiologist does monitoring of the fetal heart by echocardiography. We're able to look at blood flow patterns through the heart, the various structures and the flow towards the different organs, heart function. We look at the heart rate. We're able to feed that information back to the surgeons and to the anesthesiologist that's managing the mother. The neurosurgeon then comes in and he and I do the myelomeningocele repair exactly like you would do in a newborn after birth. I trim the sac of abnormal skin away from the nerve tissue. It's important to do that because that skin tissue, if I leave it behind, can become a cyst. There can be a problem later on. We then put the nerve tissue back into the spinal canal where it's supposed to be and then I try to get a three-layer closure. First layer is the dura. That's the normal covering of the brain and the spinal cord. The second layer is the fascia. That's kind of like muscle-type tissue. And then the third layer is the skin. The goal is to cover the unprotected spinal cord so that it's a watertight protective closure. It needs to be watertight for two reasons. One is that you want to stop the damage caused by amniotic fluid exposure for the rest of the pregnancy. And you also want to stop the leakage of cerebral spinal fluid out through the back that plays an important role in the development of hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. So if you stop the leak back here, the hindbrain can go back and the hydrocephalus is less of an issue. Once the uterine wound is closed, the maternal abdomen is closed, including the skin with a plastic surgical closure. All the layers are closed with an absorbable stitch that will dissolve once the mother's wound is healed."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

The neurosurgeon then comes in and he and I do the myelomeningocele repair exactly like you would do in a newborn after birth. I trim the sac of abnormal skin away from the nerve tissue. It's important to do that because that skin tissue, if I leave it behind, can become a cyst. There can be a problem later on. We then put the nerve tissue back into the spinal canal where it's supposed to be and then I try to get a three-layer closure. First layer is the dura. That's the normal covering of the brain and the spinal cord. The second layer is the fascia. That's kind of like muscle-type tissue. And then the third layer is the skin. The goal is to cover the unprotected spinal cord so that it's a watertight protective closure. It needs to be watertight for two reasons. One is that you want to stop the damage caused by amniotic fluid exposure for the rest of the pregnancy. And you also want to stop the leakage of cerebral spinal fluid out through the back that plays an important role in the development of hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. So if you stop the leak back here, the hindbrain can go back and the hydrocephalus is less of an issue.

All the layers are closed with an absorbable stitch that will dissolve once the mother's wound is healed."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

It's a very large OR because there's a lot of equipment that's there and there are a lot of people involved in this. There are a couple of anesthesiologists. There's the fetal team. Two to three surgeons in the room. There's a cardiologist in the room who monitors the baby's heart through the entire procedure. There's a neurosurgeon who actually does the myelomeningocele repair. There's an obstetrician or maternal fetal medicine specialist in the room who monitors the mother's uterus and performs ultrasound so that we make sure we put the incision in the uterus where we need to put it. And it all has to be carefully choreographed so that everybody is focused on what their role is, what they need to do, but everybody has to work seamlessly together. The mother goes under deep general anesthesia. General anesthesia is important for at least three reasons. It anesthetizes the mother, anesthetizes the fetus, and also gives us very good uterine relaxation, relaxation of the uterine muscle, which is very important for the operation. An ultrasound is done to look at the fetal position and then a sideways wound is made, almost hip bone to hip bone, halfway between the belly button and the pubic bone to expose the uterus. Oft times the obstetrician will move the fetus within the uterus so that the myelomeningocele or spina bifida lesion is right underneath where we're going to make the cut in the uterus because the baby basically stays inside the uterus during the operation. The cut in the uterus is done again under ultrasound guidance, sterile intraoperative ultrasound guidance with a uterine stapling device that fires absorbable staples that pinch off all the blood vessels and keep the membranes around the baby tacked up to the muscle layer of the uterus. During the operation, the fetal cardiologist does monitoring of the fetal heart by echocardiography. We're able to look at blood flow patterns through the heart, the various structures and the flow towards the different organs, heart function. We look at the heart rate.

I'm the Chair of Neurosurgery here at the University of Michigan and what I'd like to talk to you about today is what happens after the baby is born. A child with spina bifida will have life-long issues that will need to be addresses and followed up with doctors in a variety of subspecialties. In the first hours of life, a group of physicians including the neonatologist and neurosurgeons will assess a child in the intensive care unit. The neonatal intensive care unit is generally the place where such children are placed shortly after birth. It's that assessment which helps us decide when and how we're going to take care of the child in the first days of life. So after the baby is born, one of the most important things that we need to make certain of is what we do for all children, which is are there any problems in terms of breathing? Are there any problems in terms of infection? Is their heart working well? And after we get through all of that, the vast, vast majority of children will have no problems in that area, we then are particularly interested as to whether the baby will have the development of hydrocephalus. The repair of the myelomeningocele usually occurs within the first 24 to 48 hours and the decision about whether any kind of diversionary procedure for the cerebral spinal fluid to deal with the hydrocephalus is something which also will be made within the first day or two of life. But in many cases dealing with the hydrocephalus is something which needs to be followed over time and therefore may not be done at the same time as the repair of the myelomeningocele. After that there are other additional things that need to be looked at. The doctors from urology and orthopedic surgery will examine the baby to make certain that the bladder and the bowel functions are okay, that there are no specific problems with how the legs are working or the spine. And the neurosurgeon will be particularly important to look at whether the baby has any additional problems that require neurosurgical intervention. If the baby has had a repair of the myelomeningocele in utero then the neurosurgeon will be primarily looking at that repair site to make certain that it's okay and not having any problems. If the baby did not have a repair in utero then that's something that will also be done in the first days of life. The timing of that will depend a little bit on each child. We need to make certain that the baby is safe for an anesthetic and we also need to make certain that we often use our plastic surgery colleagues to help us make certain that there's adequate skin closure in these children. Over the lifetime of a baby they'll be necessary follow-up with each of the specialists I talked about. The neurosurgeon to make certain that the neurologic function continues and that there's no problem. The orthopedic surgeon to make certain that the spine, particularly with respect to scoliosis, and the lower extremities, particularly with respect to how they're formed and how the walking is going. And the urologist because almost all children with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, have problems with their bladder and bowel function that will require the urologist to follow them. Children with myelomeningocele require a multidisciplinary approach to their care. Because the life expectancy of a child with myelomeningocele is really quite good and that we expect them to grow up to be adults and to have normal lives with respect to their disabilities, we also recognize that it's a lifetime process of working through multidisciplinary care to achieve the best results for these children. Therefore it's a group of specialists who understand the complexity of myelomeningocele, who'll be taking care of the child, not only as an infant but as a young adult and onwards into full adulthood."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

The neonatal intensive care unit is generally the place where such children are placed shortly after birth. It's that assessment which helps us decide when and how we're going to take care of the child in the first days of life. So after the baby is born, one of the most important things that we need to make certain of is what we do for all children, which is are there any problems in terms of breathing? Are there any problems in terms of infection? Is their heart working well? And after we get through all of that, the vast, vast majority of children will have no problems in that area, we then are particularly interested as to whether the baby will have the development of hydrocephalus. The repair of the myelomeningocele usually occurs within the first 24 to 48 hours and the decision about whether any kind of diversionary procedure for the cerebral spinal fluid to deal with the hydrocephalus is something which also will be made within the first day or two of life. But in many cases dealing with the hydrocephalus is something which needs to be followed over time and therefore may not be done at the same time as the repair of the myelomeningocele. After that there are other additional things that need to be looked at. The doctors from urology and orthopedic surgery will examine the baby to make certain that the bladder and the bowel functions are okay, that there are no specific problems with how the legs are working or the spine. And the neurosurgeon will be particularly important to look at whether the baby has any additional problems that require neurosurgical intervention. If the baby has had a repair of the myelomeningocele in utero then the neurosurgeon will be primarily looking at that repair site to make certain that it's okay and not having any problems. If the baby did not have a repair in utero then that's something that will also be done in the first days of life. The timing of that will depend a little bit on each child. We need to make certain that the baby is safe for an anesthetic and we also need to make certain that we often use our plastic surgery colleagues to help us make certain that there's adequate skin closure in these children. Over the lifetime of a baby they'll be necessary follow-up with each of the specialists I talked about. The neurosurgeon to make certain that the neurologic function continues and that there's no problem. The orthopedic surgeon to make certain that the spine, particularly with respect to scoliosis, and the lower extremities, particularly with respect to how they're formed and how the walking is going. And the urologist because almost all children with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, have problems with their bladder and bowel function that will require the urologist to follow them. Children with myelomeningocele require a multidisciplinary approach to their care. Because the life expectancy of a child with myelomeningocele is really quite good and that we expect them to grow up to be adults and to have normal lives with respect to their disabilities, we also recognize that it's a lifetime process of working through multidisciplinary care to achieve the best results for these children. Therefore it's a group of specialists who understand the complexity of myelomeningocele, who'll be taking care of the child, not only as an infant but as a young adult and onwards into full adulthood."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

It takes a team, it takes a multidisciplinary team, working in a very collegial, cooperative, fully integrated way. You could not possibly do this surgery without this kind of a team. And that sort of experience is irreplaceable. It is volume, it's having patients steadily doing this, keeping the team sharp, that's critical to the success of this.

So when you come to CHOP and the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment, you have the benefit of all of that expertise. It's the same team. We've been working with the same people. We're like a finely oiled machine. So for a family who's carrying a fetus with spina bifida, you really want to go to a place that knows very well and has seen all the problems that can occur so that there really are no surprises. Hearing your concerns and being able to answer those questions is incredibly reassuring to families. We'll all face challenges in life, but it's nice to start off without some of those major challenges when you can have science and medicine come together to make the life better. Sean came out with his toes wiggling, kicking and screaming so to speak, and he's been doing that ever since. He runs, he jumps, he plays, he does everything he wants to do. He knows that there's some limitations, but I think he also knows that he's very fortunate. We don't dwell on the spina bifida, but we don't ignore it either. It's part of our lives. It's part of who Sean is, there's no question about that. We are very lucky that his quality of life, and ours, is just incredible. Absolutely incredible. It's wonderful that we can provide families with all these options and give the families the opportunities to learn everything they can about their babies. It takes a team, it takes a multidisciplinary team, working in a very collegial, cooperative, fully integrated way. You could not possibly do this surgery without this kind of a team. And that sort of experience is irreplaceable. It is volume, it's having patients steadily doing this, keeping the team sharp, that's critical to the success of this. It is easy to get excited and be committed when the entire team is committed. I think that's what makes Chopper a really unique place. Very supportive of research, very supportive of families, very supportive and focused on doing whatever it takes to improve outcomes for children."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

We found out we were pregnant with twins, so I was high risk. So we went to a specialist to have an ultrasound and one of the twins had passed and then I can remember the doctor just doing the ultrasound over Emerson to make sure everything looked good. He was taking a bit longer than I had expected, so I finally asked him, I said, is everything okay? And he said, you know, I'm looking at her head and he said, I'm seeing some signs that are indicative of spina bifida. And he said, he showed me the shapes on the ultrasound and he said her head, her brain is in the shape of a lemon and then he also said the cerebellum was in the shape of a banana and he said those are two classic signs of spina bifida. So when you hear that, it's, oh my gosh, that's devastating news. Through my anxiety and fear, I just asked him what does spina bifida mean for her? And he said, it means that she will probably never walk. It's a birth defect where the back is open. She will have paralysis, she will have brain damage, she will have a poor quality of life. It was heart-wrenching at that time. It was a bad day, especially for my wife. You know, when you lose a child due to miscarriage and then get this diagnosis. So I immediately started researching that when we got home and that's when we found out about the fetal center here at Texas Children's. We were able to come in and do the qualification process, which is a two-day process. It was very, very intense, met with so many physicians, surgeons. It was a long day. When the patient is coming to us with a diagnosis of neuro tube defect, first we have a comprehensive evaluation of the fetus. The patient will have the fetal MRI ultrasound. The patient will have a meeting with our pediatric surgeons, with our pediatric neurosurgeons, and with the fetal intervention team. And the way that we are approaching is we say the standard for the care at this point is open fetal surgery. And then we also offer the experimental technique that we innovate in the Texas Children's Hospital as a phytoscopy neuro tube defect. We knew going in that if we were a candidate, we were going to do the surgery no matter what. We just wanted to give the best opportunity at life and the best opportunity for Emerson to have the best life that she could. If we can close this defect at the time that the baby is inside the womb, the baby will have a better benefit regarding of the need of the ventricular amniotic shunt. That means it significantly decreases the numbers, and also it will preserve the lower extremity movement. That means many of these babies can walk independently after the surgery. The team here at Texas Children's made the decision a lot easier for us. There's just so much confidence in the room. Even though we were only the 16th couple to have the surgery here, they just gave us a lot of confidence and the level of service and care was unlike anything we had ever seen from a hospital or a doctor's office. Surgery day was scary. I remember we had surgery the day after Christmas. First Dr. Belfort came out and said, we've got the baby positioned, everything's going fine. And then a little while later, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Shammey came out and said, Dr. Whitehead's now repairing Emerson's back. Everything went really, really well. So I was very relieved. Dr. Shammey said, today's the day. Baby Emerson is coming. And we're like, oh gosh. So we called all of our family and said, Emerson, they're about to take me back. She's going to be delivered today. And everybody said, is this an April Fool's joke? Are you kidding? I said, no, it's not an April Fool's joke. She's actually coming today. So she was born on April 1st, 2014. We were coming twice a year, but as Emerson progressed and has gotten better and the outcome has been really far exceeding what our expectations were, we only have to come once a year now. The care team here at Texas Children's, the Spina Bifida Clinic is wonderful. We go one day, it's a long day, but we get to see every single specialty. You know, one of the amazing things about the Spina Bifida program at Texas Children's is that we take a comprehensive approach to patient care. So our program provides care for families across the lifespan, as I mentioned, but also divided by subspecialties. So when a family comes to our center, they're able to see neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, any other subspecialty that is related to their condition specific or their need. She likes Spina Bifida Clinic. She gets to meet new friends. The doctors get to see her grow. They're amazed by her progress. Her parents have done an amazing job at following up in our program and doing everything that they can to assure that outcomes are lasting and positive. As she heads into the school years, I think her prognosis is second to none. She's a mess. She loves to run and jump and play and swim. Very spunky. She definitely has an independent streak, but she is so sweet, so full of life and joy."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

And the way that we are approaching is we say the standard for the care at this point is open fetal surgery. And then we also offer the experimental technique that we innovate in the Texas Children's Hospital as a phytoscopy neuro tube defect. We knew going in that if we were a candidate, we were going to do the surgery no matter what. We just wanted to give the best opportunity at life and the best opportunity for Emerson to have the best life that she could. If we can close this defect at the time that the baby is inside the womb, the baby will have a better benefit regarding of the need of the ventricular amniotic shunt. That means it significantly decreases the numbers, and also it will preserve the lower extremity movement. That means many of these babies can walk independently after the surgery. The team here at Texas Children's made the decision a lot easier for us. There's just so much confidence in the room. Even though we were only the 16th couple to have the surgery here, they just gave us a lot of confidence and the level of service and care was unlike anything we had ever seen from a hospital or a doctor's office. Surgery day was scary. I remember we had surgery the day after Christmas. First Dr. Belfort came out and said, we've got the baby positioned, everything's going fine. And then a little while later, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Shammey came out and said, Dr. Whitehead's now repairing Emerson's back. Everything went really, really well. So I was very relieved. Dr. Shammey said, today's the day. Baby Emerson is coming. And we're like, oh gosh. So we called all of our family and said, Emerson, they're about to take me back. She's going to be delivered today. And everybody said, is this an April Fool's joke? Are you kidding? I said, no, it's not an April Fool's joke. She's actually coming today. So she was born on April 1st, 2014. We were coming twice a year, but as Emerson progressed and has gotten better and the outcome has been really far exceeding what our expectations were, we only have to come once a year now. The care team here at Texas Children's, the Spina Bifida Clinic is wonderful. We go one day, it's a long day, but we get to see every single specialty. You know, one of the amazing things about the Spina Bifida program at Texas Children's is that we take a comprehensive approach to patient care. So our program provides care for families across the lifespan, as I mentioned, but also divided by subspecialties. So when a family comes to our center, they're able to see neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, any other subspecialty that is related to their condition specific or their need. She likes Spina Bifida Clinic. She gets to meet new friends. The doctors get to see her grow. They're amazed by her progress. Her parents have done an amazing job at following up in our program and doing everything that they can to assure that outcomes are lasting and positive. As she heads into the school years, I think her prognosis is second to none. She's a mess. She loves to run and jump and play and swim. Very spunky.

He was taking a bit longer than I had expected, so I finally asked him, I said, is everything okay? And he said, you know, I'm looking at her head and he said, I'm seeing some signs that are indicative of spina bifida. And he said, he showed me the shapes on the ultrasound and he said her head, her brain is in the shape of a lemon and then he also said the cerebellum was in the shape of a banana and he said those are two classic signs of spina bifida. So when you hear that, it's, oh my gosh, that's devastating news. Through my anxiety and fear, I just asked him what does spina bifida mean for her?

And he said, he showed me the shapes on the ultrasound and he said her head, her brain is in the shape of a lemon and then he also said the cerebellum was in the shape of a banana and he said those are two classic signs of spina bifida. So when you hear that, it's, oh my gosh, that's devastating news. Through my anxiety and fear, I just asked him what does spina bifida mean for her? And he said, it means that she will probably never walk. It's a birth defect where the back is open. She will have paralysis, she will have brain damage, she will have a poor quality of life. It was heart-wrenching at that time. It was a bad day, especially for my wife. You know, when you lose a child due to miscarriage and then get this diagnosis. So I immediately started researching that when we got home and that's when we found out about the fetal center here at Texas Children's. We were able to come in and do the qualification process, which is a two-day process. It was very, very intense, met with so many physicians, surgeons. It was a long day. When the patient is coming to us with a diagnosis of neuro tube defect, first we have a comprehensive evaluation of the fetus. The patient will have the fetal MRI ultrasound. The patient will have a meeting with our pediatric surgeons, with our pediatric neurosurgeons, and with the fetal intervention team. And the way that we are approaching is we say the standard for the care at this point is open fetal surgery. And then we also offer the experimental technique that we innovate in the Texas Children's Hospital as a phytoscopy neuro tube defect. We knew going in that if we were a candidate, we were going to do the surgery no matter what. We just wanted to give the best opportunity at life and the best opportunity for Emerson to have the best life that she could. If we can close this defect at the time that the baby is inside the womb, the baby will have a better benefit regarding of the need of the ventricular amniotic shunt. That means it significantly decreases the numbers, and also it will preserve the lower extremity movement. That means many of these babies can walk independently after the surgery. The team here at Texas Children's made the decision a lot easier for us. There's just so much confidence in the room. Even though we were only the 16th couple to have the surgery here, they just gave us a lot of confidence and the level of service and care was unlike anything we had ever seen from a hospital or a doctor's office. Surgery day was scary. I remember we had surgery the day after Christmas. First Dr. Belfort came out and said, we've got the baby positioned, everything's going fine. And then a little while later, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Shammey came out and said, Dr. Whitehead's now repairing Emerson's back. Everything went really, really well. So I was very relieved. Dr. Shammey said, today's the day. Baby Emerson is coming. And we're like, oh gosh. So we called all of our family and said, Emerson, they're about to take me back. She's going to be delivered today. And everybody said, is this an April Fool's joke? Are you kidding? I said, no, it's not an April Fool's joke. She's actually coming today. So she was born on April 1st, 2014. We were coming twice a year, but as Emerson progressed and has gotten better and the outcome has been really far exceeding what our expectations were, we only have to come once a year now. The care team here at Texas Children's, the Spina Bifida Clinic is wonderful. We go one day, it's a long day, but we get to see every single specialty. You know, one of the amazing things about the Spina Bifida program at Texas Children's is that we take a comprehensive approach to patient care. So our program provides care for families across the lifespan, as I mentioned, but also divided by subspecialties. So when a family comes to our center, they're able to see neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, any other subspecialty that is related to their condition specific or their need. She likes Spina Bifida Clinic. She gets to meet new friends. The doctors get to see her grow. They're amazed by her progress. Her parents have done an amazing job at following up in our program and doing everything that they can to assure that outcomes are lasting and positive. As she heads into the school years, I think her prognosis is second to none. She's a mess. She loves to run and jump and play and swim. Very spunky. She definitely has an independent streak, but she is so sweet, so full of life and joy."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Very early on in fetal development, the ectoderm, which is the outer layer of the fertilized egg, starts to develop a bit of a ridge that eventually becomes the neural tube. This neural tube goes on to become the spinal cord, the brain, as well as tissues that enclose and protect them, called the meninges, and spina bifida occurs when a portion of this neural tube fails to close properly, typically in the lower back. This constitutes a defect or absence of the vertebral arches due to failure of mesoderm to organize over the region of the defect, and it may or may not involve the underlying meninges and neural tissue. Alright so there are three main types of spina bifida, the first is myelomeningocele, also called meningomyelocele, and this is the most severe of the three and occurs when the spinal cord and the surrounding meninges protrude out of an opening in the bony vertebrae and are held together by a sack of skin that pouches out from the back. In really severe cases, there is no skin at all, and the nerves of the spinal cord are therefore exposed, a condition called \u2018open spina bifida, and this can cause serious damage to the exposed nerves as well as risk an infection, resulting in symptoms like loss of sensation or paralysis in the areas of the body below the damaged site, bladder or bowel movement problems, seizures, as well as leg and foot deformities. Now a myelomeningocele is typically associated with a condition called an Arnold Chiari II malformation, which is where cerebellar and brainstem tissue slip down into the foramen magnum\u2014the opening at the base of the skull. This Arnold Chiari II malformation results in a variety of symptoms related to the cerebellum and often resulting in hydrocephalus\u2014an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Alright the second type of spina bifida is meningocele, sometimes called a meningeal cyst. In this condition, the prenatal spinal deformities result in only the meninges (and not the spinal nerves) slipping into the gaps between the deformed vertebrae. This one\u2019s the least common form of spina bifida, and because the spinal cord itself is not damaged, these individuals often do not experience the severe symptoms that are seen in myelomeningocele. Alright the third type and finaly type is spina bifida occulta, and this is the most common and most mild form of spina bifida. In fact, \u2018occulta\u2019 is latin for hidden, which is appropriate since many of the normal prenatal tests used to diagnose spina bifida don\u2019t catch the disorder because the deformities in the tissues of the lower back are tiny. In spina bifida occulta, the spinal cord and surrounding tissue don\u2019t protrude, nor is any of the tissue forced into the spaces in between the vertebrae. Since the spinal nerves are undamaged, people with this form of the disorder are often asymptomatic, and the condition is usually only found accidently later in life. At most, people might have hair, a dimple, or birthmark on their back above the site of the lesion. Now, the exact cause of all three types of spina bifida isn\u2019t known, but there are known risk factors like folate or Vitamin B9 deficiency during fetal development. Therefore prenatal vitamins include folic acid, which is the manufactured form of folate. The developmental deformities, though, that cause spina bifida often take place in the fourth week of pregnancy (which is 21-28 days) and this could be before a woman might know she\u2019s even pregnant, and therefore she\u2019s not taking prenatal vitamins yet. To help combat this, enriched grain products like breakfast cereals made with whole grains have folic acid added to flour as a general preventative measure. Other risk factors for having a child with spina bifida include obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism like certain anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis for the most severe form of spina bifida\u2014myelomeningocele\u2014is often done prenatally by looking for an increased level of alpha fetoprotein (or AFP) in the mother\u2019s serum, which can happen when the skin surrounding the fetus\u2019s spine is missing and AFP leaks into the amniotic fluid and into the mother\u2019s bloodstream. AFP, though, can be elevated by other conditions as well so in order to get a more exact diagnosis, additional blood tests for Human chorionic gonadotropin (or HCG), inhibin A, and estriol, as well as an ultrasound are usually done. In more serious cases, amniocentesis (where a sample is taken directly from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus) can be performed. For treatment, prenatal surgery is done to close a myelomeningocele, but this surgery can be dangerous to the developing fetus as well as the mother. In cases where postnatal surgery is chosen, it is often done within the first few days of an infant's life in order to minimize the risk of infection like meningitis. Even if the surgery is successful, people with this condition typically need additional interventions such as urinary catheterization to help with urination and crutches or wheelchairs in case of paralysis or low muscle tone, because the damaged or underdeveloped spinal nerves can\u2019t be repaired. Alright, as a quick recap, the three types of spina bifida are spina bifida occulta, which is the most common and least severe, meningocele, which is the least common and also typically not very severe, and myelomeningocele, which is the most severe form of spina bifida.

Very early on in fetal development, the ectoderm, which is the outer layer of the fertilized egg, starts to develop a bit of a ridge that eventually becomes the neural tube. This neural tube goes on to become the spinal cord, the brain, as well as tissues that enclose and protect them, called the meninges, and spina bifida occurs when a portion of this neural tube fails to close properly, typically in the lower back. This constitutes a defect or absence of the vertebral arches due to failure of mesoderm to organize over the region of the defect, and it may or may not involve the underlying meninges and neural tissue. Alright so there are three main types of spina bifida, the first is myelomeningocele, also called meningomyelocele, and this is the most severe of the three and occurs when the spinal cord and the surrounding meninges protrude out of an opening in the bony vertebrae and are held together by a sack of skin that pouches out from the back. In really severe cases, there is no skin at all, and the nerves of the spinal cord are therefore exposed, a condition called \u2018open spina bifida, and this can cause serious damage to the exposed nerves as well as risk an infection, resulting in symptoms like loss of sensation or paralysis in the areas of the body below the damaged site, bladder or bowel movement problems, seizures, as well as leg and foot deformities. Now a myelomeningocele is typically associated with a condition called an Arnold Chiari II malformation, which is where cerebellar and brainstem tissue slip down into the foramen magnum\u2014the opening at the base of the skull. This Arnold Chiari II malformation results in a variety of symptoms related to the cerebellum and often resulting in hydrocephalus\u2014an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Alright the second type of spina bifida is meningocele, sometimes called a meningeal cyst. In this condition, the prenatal spinal deformities result in only the meninges (and not the spinal nerves) slipping into the gaps between the deformed vertebrae. This one\u2019s the least common form of spina bifida, and because the spinal cord itself is not damaged, these individuals often do not experience the severe symptoms that are seen in myelomeningocele. Alright the third type and finaly type is spina bifida occulta, and this is the most common and most mild form of spina bifida. In fact, \u2018occulta\u2019 is latin for hidden, which is appropriate since many of the normal prenatal tests used to diagnose spina bifida don\u2019t catch the disorder because the deformities in the tissues of the lower back are tiny. In spina bifida occulta, the spinal cord and surrounding tissue don\u2019t protrude, nor is any of the tissue forced into the spaces in between the vertebrae. Since the spinal nerves are undamaged, people with this form of the disorder are often asymptomatic, and the condition is usually only found accidently later in life. At most, people might have hair, a dimple, or birthmark on their back above the site of the lesion. Now, the exact cause of all three types of spina bifida isn\u2019t known, but there are known risk factors like folate or Vitamin B9 deficiency during fetal development. Therefore prenatal vitamins include folic acid, which is the manufactured form of folate. The developmental deformities, though, that cause spina bifida often take place in the fourth week of pregnancy (which is 21-28 days) and this could be before a woman might know she\u2019s even pregnant, and therefore she\u2019s not taking prenatal vitamins yet. To help combat this, enriched grain products like breakfast cereals made with whole grains have folic acid added to flour as a general preventative measure. Other risk factors for having a child with spina bifida include obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism like certain anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis for the most severe form of spina bifida\u2014myelomeningocele\u2014is often done prenatally by looking for an increased level of alpha fetoprotein (or AFP) in the mother\u2019s serum, which can happen when the skin surrounding the fetus\u2019s spine is missing and AFP leaks into the amniotic fluid and into the mother\u2019s bloodstream. AFP, though, can be elevated by other conditions as well so in order to get a more exact diagnosis, additional blood tests for Human chorionic gonadotropin (or HCG), inhibin A, and estriol, as well as an ultrasound are usually done. In more serious cases, amniocentesis (where a sample is taken directly from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus) can be performed. For treatment, prenatal surgery is done to close a myelomeningocele, but this surgery can be dangerous to the developing fetus as well as the mother. In cases where postnatal surgery is chosen, it is often done within the first few days of an infant's life in order to minimize the risk of infection like meningitis. Even if the surgery is successful, people with this condition typically need additional interventions such as urinary catheterization to help with urination and crutches or wheelchairs in case of paralysis or low muscle tone, because the damaged or underdeveloped spinal nerves can\u2019t be repaired. Alright, as a quick recap, the three types of spina bifida are spina bifida occulta, which is the most common and least severe, meningocele, which is the least common and also typically not very severe, and myelomeningocele, which is the most severe form of spina bifida.

Very early on in fetal development, the ectoderm, which is the outer layer of the fertilized egg, starts to develop a bit of a ridge that eventually becomes the neural tube. This neural tube goes on to become the spinal cord, the brain, as well as tissues that enclose and protect them, called the meninges, and spina bifida occurs when a portion of this neural tube fails to close properly, typically in the lower back. This constitutes a defect or absence of the vertebral arches due to failure of mesoderm to organize over the region of the defect, and it may or may not involve the underlying meninges and neural tissue. Alright so there are three main types of spina bifida, the first is myelomeningocele, also called meningomyelocele, and this is the most severe of the three and occurs when the spinal cord and the surrounding meninges protrude out of an opening in the bony vertebrae and are held together by a sack of skin that pouches out from the back. In really severe cases, there is no skin at all, and the nerves of the spinal cord are therefore exposed, a condition called \u2018open spina bifida, and this can cause serious damage to the exposed nerves as well as risk an infection, resulting in symptoms like loss of sensation or paralysis in the areas of the body below the damaged site, bladder or bowel movement problems, seizures, as well as leg and foot deformities. Now a myelomeningocele is typically associated with a condition called an Arnold Chiari II malformation, which is where cerebellar and brainstem tissue slip down into the foramen magnum\u2014the opening at the base of the skull. This Arnold Chiari II malformation results in a variety of symptoms related to the cerebellum and often resulting in hydrocephalus\u2014an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Alright the second type of spina bifida is meningocele, sometimes called a meningeal cyst. In this condition, the prenatal spinal deformities result in only the meninges (and not the spinal nerves) slipping into the gaps between the deformed vertebrae. This one\u2019s the least common form of spina bifida, and because the spinal cord itself is not damaged, these individuals often do not experience the severe symptoms that are seen in myelomeningocele. Alright the third type and finaly type is spina bifida occulta, and this is the most common and most mild form of spina bifida. In fact, \u2018occulta\u2019 is latin for hidden, which is appropriate since many of the normal prenatal tests used to diagnose spina bifida don\u2019t catch the disorder because the deformities in the tissues of the lower back are tiny. In spina bifida occulta, the spinal cord and surrounding tissue don\u2019t protrude, nor is any of the tissue forced into the spaces in between the vertebrae. Since the spinal nerves are undamaged, people with this form of the disorder are often asymptomatic, and the condition is usually only found accidently later in life. At most, people might have hair, a dimple, or birthmark on their back above the site of the lesion. Now, the exact cause of all three types of spina bifida isn\u2019t known, but there are known risk factors like folate or Vitamin B9 deficiency during fetal development. Therefore prenatal vitamins include folic acid, which is the manufactured form of folate. The developmental deformities, though, that cause spina bifida often take place in the fourth week of pregnancy (which is 21-28 days) and this could be before a woman might know she\u2019s even pregnant, and therefore she\u2019s not taking prenatal vitamins yet. To help combat this, enriched grain products like breakfast cereals made with whole grains have folic acid added to flour as a general preventative measure. Other risk factors for having a child with spina bifida include obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism like certain anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis for the most severe form of spina bifida\u2014myelomeningocele\u2014is often done prenatally by looking for an increased level of alpha fetoprotein (or AFP) in the mother\u2019s serum, which can happen when the skin surrounding the fetus\u2019s spine is missing and AFP leaks into the amniotic fluid and into the mother\u2019s bloodstream. AFP, though, can be elevated by other conditions as well so in order to get a more exact diagnosis, additional blood tests for Human chorionic gonadotropin (or HCG), inhibin A, and estriol, as well as an ultrasound are usually done. In more serious cases, amniocentesis (where a sample is taken directly from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus) can be performed. For treatment, prenatal surgery is done to close a myelomeningocele, but this surgery can be dangerous to the developing fetus as well as the mother. In cases where postnatal surgery is chosen, it is often done within the first few days of an infant's life in order to minimize the risk of infection like meningitis. Even if the surgery is successful, people with this condition typically need additional interventions such as urinary catheterization to help with urination and crutches or wheelchairs in case of paralysis or low muscle tone, because the damaged or underdeveloped spinal nerves can\u2019t be repaired. Alright, as a quick recap, the three types of spina bifida are spina bifida occulta, which is the most common and least severe, meningocele, which is the least common and also typically not very severe, and myelomeningocele, which is the most severe form of spina bifida.

Very early on in fetal development, the ectoderm, which is the outer layer of the fertilized egg, starts to develop a bit of a ridge that eventually becomes the neural tube. This neural tube goes on to become the spinal cord, the brain, as well as tissues that enclose and protect them, called the meninges, and spina bifida occurs when a portion of this neural tube fails to close properly, typically in the lower back. This constitutes a defect or absence of the vertebral arches due to failure of mesoderm to organize over the region of the defect, and it may or may not involve the underlying meninges and neural tissue. Alright so there are three main types of spina bifida, the first is myelomeningocele, also called meningomyelocele, and this is the most severe of the three and occurs when the spinal cord and the surrounding meninges protrude out of an opening in the bony vertebrae and are held together by a sack of skin that pouches out from the back. In really severe cases, there is no skin at all, and the nerves of the spinal cord are therefore exposed, a condition called \u2018open spina bifida, and this can cause serious damage to the exposed nerves as well as risk an infection, resulting in symptoms like loss of sensation or paralysis in the areas of the body below the damaged site, bladder or bowel movement problems, seizures, as well as leg and foot deformities. Now a myelomeningocele is typically associated with a condition called an Arnold Chiari II malformation, which is where cerebellar and brainstem tissue slip down into the foramen magnum\u2014the opening at the base of the skull. This Arnold Chiari II malformation results in a variety of symptoms related to the cerebellum and often resulting in hydrocephalus\u2014an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Alright the second type of spina bifida is meningocele, sometimes called a meningeal cyst. In this condition, the prenatal spinal deformities result in only the meninges (and not the spinal nerves) slipping into the gaps between the deformed vertebrae. This one\u2019s the least common form of spina bifida, and because the spinal cord itself is not damaged, these individuals often do not experience the severe symptoms that are seen in myelomeningocele. Alright the third type and finaly type is spina bifida occulta, and this is the most common and most mild form of spina bifida. In fact, \u2018occulta\u2019 is latin for hidden, which is appropriate since many of the normal prenatal tests used to diagnose spina bifida don\u2019t catch the disorder because the deformities in the tissues of the lower back are tiny. In spina bifida occulta, the spinal cord and surrounding tissue don\u2019t protrude, nor is any of the tissue forced into the spaces in between the vertebrae. Since the spinal nerves are undamaged, people with this form of the disorder are often asymptomatic, and the condition is usually only found accidently later in life. At most, people might have hair, a dimple, or birthmark on their back above the site of the lesion. Now, the exact cause of all three types of spina bifida isn\u2019t known, but there are known risk factors like folate or Vitamin B9 deficiency during fetal development. Therefore prenatal vitamins include folic acid, which is the manufactured form of folate. The developmental deformities, though, that cause spina bifida often take place in the fourth week of pregnancy (which is 21-28 days) and this could be before a woman might know she\u2019s even pregnant, and therefore she\u2019s not taking prenatal vitamins yet. To help combat this, enriched grain products like breakfast cereals made with whole grains have folic acid added to flour as a general preventative measure. Other risk factors for having a child with spina bifida include obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism like certain anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis for the most severe form of spina bifida\u2014myelomeningocele\u2014is often done prenatally by looking for an increased level of alpha fetoprotein (or AFP) in the mother\u2019s serum, which can happen when the skin surrounding the fetus\u2019s spine is missing and AFP leaks into the amniotic fluid and into the mother\u2019s bloodstream. AFP, though, can be elevated by other conditions as well so in order to get a more exact diagnosis, additional blood tests for Human chorionic gonadotropin (or HCG), inhibin A, and estriol, as well as an ultrasound are usually done. In more serious cases, amniocentesis (where a sample is taken directly from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus) can be performed. For treatment, prenatal surgery is done to close a myelomeningocele, but this surgery can be dangerous to the developing fetus as well as the mother. In cases where postnatal surgery is chosen, it is often done within the first few days of an infant's life in order to minimize the risk of infection like meningitis. Even if the surgery is successful, people with this condition typically need additional interventions such as urinary catheterization to help with urination and crutches or wheelchairs in case of paralysis or low muscle tone, because the damaged or underdeveloped spinal nerves can\u2019t be repaired. Alright, as a quick recap, the three types of spina bifida are spina bifida occulta, which is the most common and least severe, meningocele, which is the least common and also typically not very severe, and myelomeningocele, which is the most severe form of spina bifida.

Myelomeningocele is a defect in the spine. It's failure of the spinal cord to close. The spinal cord, or the neural tube as the embryologists say, forms very early in gestation, certainly before eight weeks gestation. And spina bifida is thought to be a failure of the formation and closure of that neural tube, so that the spinal cord elements are exposed to the intrauterine environment. It's a progressive process, it's a progressive injury, so that by the end of pregnancy there's been direct traumatic injury to the spinal cord, and there's been injury from the amniotic fluid itself. Because of changes in pressure and fluid flow, babies are also at risk for developing hydrocephalus. Which is a fluid buildup on the brain, and which damages the developing brain. Virtually every child with myelomeningocele or spina bifida has an Arnold-Chiarri malformation on x-ray. And what it is, is that the back part of the brain, called the cerebellum, that has a lot to do with control of motor movements, is wedged down into your neck. The cerebral spinal fluid that cushions the brain and cushions the spinal cord leaks out through the back through the open spina bifida defect. That leads to the back part of the brain getting summed down into the upper part of the spinal canal. That in turn can block the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the brain, because the fluid is produced in the brain and then there's no way for it to circulate beyond that blockage point. So if there is a blockage in the flow of that fluid, then the water builds up inside the ventricle. So you've probably heard the term water on the brain. The water isn't on the brain, it's inside the brain. If you don't treat that, then you end up with a massively enlarged head, you die, or you end up with severe mental retardation. So in order to minimize that ongoing damage of pressure from the fluid, the pediatric neurosurgeon places a shunt tube. It's a simple device. This is a shunt. It's made out of silicone. This end goes through a hole in the back of the head into the water cavity and tunnels down under the skin and goes into the abdomen, which is able to absorb the fluid. It's not a cure. It treats the symptom. It doesn't treat the disease. Once you have a shunt, there are multiple complications that can arise from it. The shunt can become infected, which is a serious complication, because then the brain and the layers in the brain can become infected with meningitis and sephalitis. And with each bout of infection, that can affect the brain function. And then, of course, there are mechanical problems. They clog, they break, they get to be too short, they migrate. So it's not unusual for a child with spondabifida who has a shunt to require that shunt, and not only for life, but to have that shunt changed at least five or six times during the course of their life. It's important for parents to understand the potential complications or ramifications of spondabifida after the diagnosis is made. A child may experience difficulty with apnea, forgetting to breathe. They may also have breathing problems, choking, blue spells. In the worst case, you end up with a child who's on a ventilator with a tracheostomy and a tube in the stomach to eat. And that is a huge impact on your quality of life. Apnea can cause paralysis in the lower extremities that can interfere with the baby's ability to walk or they may even be wheelchair dependent. They also have difficulty with their bowel and bladder function. Most of these kids, when they become older, have to catheterize or else they have to wear diapers. They can develop significant curvatures of the spine because of instability, bony instabilities of the spine if they have a high lesion. Because of the lack of innervation to the feet and the ankles, there can be the formation of club feet or the medical term is telopes as a consequence. So that requires orthopedic intervention after birth. And then there are problems that can come on later on in life. It's not even necessarily done when you're a baby. You can get tethered cord, which means that the nerve tissue gets caught up in scar tissue and you can lose function. So it's a lifelong issue of disability."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

This end goes through a hole in the back of the head into the water cavity and tunnels down under the skin and goes into the abdomen, which is able to absorb the fluid. It's not a cure. It treats the symptom. It doesn't treat the disease. Once you have a shunt, there are multiple complications that can arise from it. The shunt can become infected, which is a serious complication, because then the brain and the layers in the brain can become infected with meningitis and sephalitis. And with each bout of infection, that can affect the brain function. And then, of course, there are mechanical problems. They clog, they break, they get to be too short, they migrate. So it's not unusual for a child with spondabifida who has a shunt to require that shunt, and not only for life, but to have that shunt changed at least five or six times during the course of their life. It's important for parents to understand the potential complications or ramifications of spondabifida after the diagnosis is made. A child may experience difficulty with apnea, forgetting to breathe. They may also have breathing problems, choking, blue spells. In the worst case, you end up with a child who's on a ventilator with a tracheostomy and a tube in the stomach to eat. And that is a huge impact on your quality of life. Apnea can cause paralysis in the lower extremities that can interfere with the baby's ability to walk or they may even be wheelchair dependent. They also have difficulty with their bowel and bladder function. Most of these kids, when they become older, have to catheterize or else they have to wear diapers. They can develop significant curvatures of the spine because of instability, bony instabilities of the spine if they have a high lesion. Because of the lack of innervation to the feet and the ankles, there can be the formation of club feet or the medical term is telopes as a consequence. So that requires orthopedic intervention after birth. And then there are problems that can come on later on in life. It's not even necessarily done when you're a baby. You can get tethered cord, which means that the nerve tissue gets caught up in scar tissue and you can lose function.

Myelomeningocele is a defect in the spine. It's failure of the spinal cord to close. The spinal cord, or the neural tube as the embryologists say, forms very early in gestation, certainly before eight weeks gestation. And spina bifida is thought to be a failure of the formation and closure of that neural tube, so that the spinal cord elements are exposed to the intrauterine environment. It's a progressive process, it's a progressive injury, so that by the end of pregnancy there's been direct traumatic injury to the spinal cord, and there's been injury from the amniotic fluid itself. Because of changes in pressure and fluid flow, babies are also at risk for developing hydrocephalus. Which is a fluid buildup on the brain, and which damages the developing brain. Virtually every child with myelomeningocele or spina bifida has an Arnold-Chiarri malformation on x-ray. And what it is, is that the back part of the brain, called the cerebellum, that has a lot to do with control of motor movements, is wedged down into your neck. The cerebral spinal fluid that cushions the brain and cushions the spinal cord leaks out through the back through the open spina bifida defect. That leads to the back part of the brain getting summed down into the upper part of the spinal canal. That in turn can block the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the brain, because the fluid is produced in the brain and then there's no way for it to circulate beyond that blockage point. So if there is a blockage in the flow of that fluid, then the water builds up inside the ventricle. So you've probably heard the term water on the brain.

That leads to the back part of the brain getting summed down into the upper part of the spinal canal. That in turn can block the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the brain, because the fluid is produced in the brain and then there's no way for it to circulate beyond that blockage point. So if there is a blockage in the flow of that fluid, then the water builds up inside the ventricle. So you've probably heard the term water on the brain. The water isn't on the brain, it's inside the brain. If you don't treat that, then you end up with a massively enlarged head, you die, or you end up with severe mental retardation. So in order to minimize that ongoing damage of pressure from the fluid, the pediatric neurosurgeon places a shunt tube. It's a simple device. This is a shunt. It's made out of silicone. This end goes through a hole in the back of the head into the water cavity and tunnels down under the skin and goes into the abdomen, which is able to absorb the fluid. It's not a cure. It treats the symptom. It doesn't treat the disease. Once you have a shunt, there are multiple complications that can arise from it. The shunt can become infected, which is a serious complication, because then the brain and the layers in the brain can become infected with meningitis and sephalitis. And with each bout of infection, that can affect the brain function. And then, of course, there are mechanical problems. They clog, they break, they get to be too short, they migrate. So it's not unusual for a child with spondabifida who has a shunt to require that shunt, and not only for life, but to have that shunt changed at least five or six times during the course of their life. It's important for parents to understand the potential complications or ramifications of spondabifida after the diagnosis is made. A child may experience difficulty with apnea, forgetting to breathe. They may also have breathing problems, choking, blue spells. In the worst case, you end up with a child who's on a ventilator with a tracheostomy and a tube in the stomach to eat. And that is a huge impact on your quality of life. Apnea can cause paralysis in the lower extremities that can interfere with the baby's ability to walk or they may even be wheelchair dependent. They also have difficulty with their bowel and bladder function. Most of these kids, when they become older, have to catheterize or else they have to wear diapers. They can develop significant curvatures of the spine because of instability, bony instabilities of the spine if they have a high lesion. Because of the lack of innervation to the feet and the ankles, there can be the formation of club feet or the medical term is telopes as a consequence. So that requires orthopedic intervention after birth. And then there are problems that can come on later on in life. It's not even necessarily done when you're a baby. You can get tethered cord, which means that the nerve tissue gets caught up in scar tissue and you can lose function. So it's a lifelong issue of disability."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Myelomeningocele is a defect in the spine. It's failure of the spinal cord to close. The spinal cord, or the neural tube as the embryologists say, forms very early in gestation, certainly before eight weeks gestation. And spina bifida is thought to be a failure of the formation and closure of that neural tube, so that the spinal cord elements are exposed to the intrauterine environment. It's a progressive process, it's a progressive injury, so that by the end of pregnancy there's been direct traumatic injury to the spinal cord, and there's been injury from the amniotic fluid itself. Because of changes in pressure and fluid flow, babies are also at risk for developing hydrocephalus. Which is a fluid buildup on the brain, and which damages the developing brain. Virtually every child with myelomeningocele or spina bifida has an Arnold-Chiarri malformation on x-ray.

I go to the hospital a lot more than everybody else and I have to wear leg braces and stuff like that. Angie Joines - We\u2019ve encouraged Joshua\u2019s independence, since he came home from the hospital. We started him with physical therapy at six weeks of age; his physical therapist adapted all of his toys. We taught him things like swimming when he was 3 and riding a bike when he was 3. Joshua has a huge part in his own medical care. We put together a medical notebook. For each specialist, there\u2019s a category and Joshua has a page, and before every appointment he\u2019s required to write his own questions to the physician. In the school setting, he has been self-catheterizing since he was 3 years old. When we sent him to preschool at four, he went with a three-alarm watch and a bag of catheter supplies, and we gave him the confidence that he could do it. Josh Joines - I like being part of my medical team because they listen to me better than my parents. Angie Joines - From the very beginning we always thought that this spina bifida was just something on the side. We never allowed the spina bifida to come first. My name is, Ramu Mundakizhi Kaledi and I\u2019m a Health Policy Analyst at the CDC. I graduated from Georgia State University, with a bachelor\u2019s in public policy. My parents, especially my dad, pushed me to do things, just to lead a normal life. If I felt like I couldn\u2019t do something he would push me. Everyone has to learn to be independent and living on their own, managing their own lives, I\u2019m beginning to do that as well now. I go to my own doctor\u2019s appointments and manage all my doctor visits and my medical issues. I play actually on a wheelchair league and, because it\u2019s a wheelchair league, it\u2019s a small league and it\u2019s all about the community.

Hi, I\u2019m Joshua Joines and I\u2019m an 11 year old and I have Spina Bifida. I think I\u2019m just a normal kid but, there\u2019s obviously some differences. I go to the hospital a lot more than everybody else and I have to wear leg braces and stuff like that. Angie Joines - We\u2019ve encouraged Joshua\u2019s independence, since he came home from the hospital. We started him with physical therapy at six weeks of age; his physical therapist adapted all of his toys. We taught him things like swimming when he was 3 and riding a bike when he was 3. Joshua has a huge part in his own medical care. We put together a medical notebook. For each specialist, there\u2019s a category and Joshua has a page, and before every appointment he\u2019s required to write his own questions to the physician. In the school setting, he has been self-catheterizing since he was 3 years old. When we sent him to preschool at four, he went with a three-alarm watch and a bag of catheter supplies, and we gave him the confidence that he could do it. Josh Joines - I like being part of my medical team because they listen to me better than my parents. Angie Joines - From the very beginning we always thought that this spina bifida was just something on the side. We never allowed the spina bifida to come first. My name is, Ramu Mundakizhi Kaledi and I\u2019m a Health Policy Analyst at the CDC. I graduated from Georgia State University, with a bachelor\u2019s in public policy. My parents, especially my dad, pushed me to do things, just to lead a normal life. If I felt like I couldn\u2019t do something he would push me. Everyone has to learn to be independent and living on their own, managing their own lives, I\u2019m beginning to do that as well now. I go to my own doctor\u2019s appointments and manage all my doctor visits and my medical issues. I play actually on a wheelchair league and, because it\u2019s a wheelchair league, it\u2019s a small league and it\u2019s all about the community. If I could give a young person one major bit of advice, have dreams in life and, stick to those dreams.

What normally should occur early in fetal development or the development of your baby is the neural tube. Starts off as a flat plate of cells, and then around six weeks into development, that flat plate zips itself closes and forms the neural tube. Inside that tube, the nerves from our brain run down to our limbs, so to our arms and to our legs, and the neural tube forms a protective barrier so that those delicate nerves don't get damaged. In cases of spina bifida, also known as a neural tube defect, what happens is that zipping process doesn't go quite right and there can be a gap in the neural tube that allows those delicate nerves to come out of the body, usually out of the skin and they're damaged, as, in exposure to the amniotic fluid. When there is damage to those nerves when the babies are born, we do surgery to repair the opening, but the nerves have usually already suffered some damage. As a result, people or babies with spina bifida or children with spina bifida usually have some degree of paralysis or the inability to use their legs to some extent. So some people with spina bifida will undergo surgery and have a limp or need some sort of help with bracing. Other people with spina bifida will use a wheelchair, so there's some degree, but usually no matter when we are able to do surgery, there's some damage to those nerves. Spina bifida can happen in any pregnancy to any woman. We know there are some risk factors that can make a pregnancy at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida and those include moms who are diabetic, when there's been a family history of other individuals with a neural tube defect, or some women on certain medications. But most of the time, spina bifida happens in a pregnancy where we didn't know there was a higher risk, and that's why we talk so much about folic acid. Folic acid is a B vitamin that we know helps reduce the incidence of spina bifida. Usually people get folic acid in their diet, but we recommend that any woman of any childbearing age take a vitamin that has 0.4 milligrams of folic acid. Because that neural tube closes so early in pregnancy, sometimes a neural tube defect has formed before a woman even knows she's pregnant. For women that we identify that are at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida, we'll typically recommend more folic acid so it's a good idea to talk to your OB if you're considering having a baby and think you have any risk factors that would increase the risk for this birth defect."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

We knew that she had a fairly large myelomeningocele or what most people would understand as spina bifida. The spinal cord is open. If your spinal cord is open, that means your cerebral spinal fluid, it's all in communication with the outside world. So the biggest risk at that point is they can get an infection. If they get an infection, that's meningitis and that's very serious in a baby. But what we aim to do is close the skin, create a barrier between the outside world and the spinal fluid and therefore prevent an infection. Reach in with this forcep and grab the white band. Over time, it became obvious that Decatur was not actually going to be able to get away without needing a BP shunt. We follow the child's head circumference and if the head grows inappropriately, which is a sign of fluid under pressure, then we make arrangements to place a ventricular perineal shunt, which is the treatment for hydrocephalus. People who have hydrocephalus, they don't absorb the fluid, although they continue to make it. Yeah, I'll take a couple more of those and then some derma bond. So you need to move it somewhere else. So the shunt is basically plumbing to move the fluid from the brain down to the abdomen where it's ultimately reabsorbed into the bloodstream, just like it would be in the normal situation in the head. It looks good. And then once she finally got to the point where she had stabilized, was eating well, we were actually able to get her home at that point. There's our beautiful baby. We're enjoying her home right now. I think the one thing that gives these kids the best opportunity for the best outcome is that there is a coordinated kind of care center that our neurosurgeons and other specialists manage for the spina bifida clinic and that they are actually able to help these kids end up with their best outcome."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I think the one thing that gives these kids the best opportunity for the best outcome is that there is a coordinated kind of care center that our neurosurgeons and other specialists manage for the spina bifida clinic and that they are actually able to help these kids end up with their best outcome."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

June 24th we went in for our ultrasound then a doctor came in and she introduced herself and she said I'm a high-risk OB so she said she wanted to take a look and that she thought our child might have what's called spina bifida. Spina bifida is one of the more common birth defects. It's the second most common birth defect that we see in the United States. It results from the spine failing to close very early in pregnancy and it is the level of the lesion or where on the back the defect is present that determines what the level of function will be for that individual child. We met with the maternal fetal medicine team and Dr. Treadwell we met her that day and then she brought up the in utero fetal surgery but we would perform that surgery when you were still pregnant. Before the procedure even happened I had kind of talked to Dr. Treadwell just to get an idea of like what to expect and I said you know is there anyone that I can talk to so I know like what's gonna happen maybe what to pack what you know what to expect once we go home and she said well actually Casey you would be the first one. The Hilton family was the first family that had the in utero spina bifida repair here at Michigan Medicine. When we talk about prenatal surgery for spina bifida what we're literally talking about is opening the woman's abdomen opening up her uterus while she's still pregnant operating on the baby while the baby is still in the uterus closing everything up and trying to continue the pregnancy for an additional 10-12 weeks.

In this fetus with spina bifida, you can see an opening in the back, with an exposed spinal cord. Prenatal repair is most commonly done between 22 and 26 weeks gestation. Once the mother is under anesthesia, we make an incision in the abdomen to expose the womb. We may use either a transverse incision, shown here . . . or a midline incision, as shown here. This animation shows a transverse incision. After we make the incision and cut through the layer of muscle, the womb is exposed. Ultrasound helps us to confirm the position of the fetus and shows us the best location to place the first port for the surgery. We then expand the amniotic cavity using humidified and heated carbon dioxide, which creates more space for us to do the repair. To enable us to see inside the womb, we insert a camera into the amniotic cavity through the first port. Two additional ports are then placed under direct vision to allow placement of instruments for the repair. We inject a cocktail of pain medication, paralytics and medication to protect the baby\u2019s heartbeat into the gluteal muscle. We then place a stabilization stitch in the baby\u2019s upper back, above the spina bifida. We first open up the sac all the way around the spina bifida defect. Once the sac is completely open, we free the placode, or exposed portion of the spinal cord, from the surrounding tissue. This procedure, which is called untethering, allows the placode to fall back down nicely into the spinal canal. We then raise the skin flap around the defect to loosen up the skin. This will eventually help us form a water tight closure of the spinal defect. To protect the placode, we place a patch into the defect. We anchor the patch on one end to the baby\u2019s back using dissolvable sutures. A second patch is then placed to give additional protection, and again, it is secured with dissolvable sutures. We then close the skin over the spinal defect using dissolvable sutures, when the baby has enough skin to do so. If the defect is too large and we are not able to close the skin, we use a skin patch, forming a water tight closure. The stabilization stitch is removed. The repair is now complete. The ports are removed and the port sites are closed with dissolvable sutures. The amniotic fluid we removed is now replaced with warm fluid, and antibiotics are placed into the amniotic cavity.

This will eventually help us form a water tight closure of the spinal defect. To protect the placode, we place a patch into the defect. We anchor the patch on one end to the baby\u2019s back using dissolvable sutures. A second patch is then placed to give additional protection, and again, it is secured with dissolvable sutures. We then close the skin over the spinal defect using dissolvable sutures, when the baby has enough skin to do so. If the defect is too large and we are not able to close the skin, we use a skin patch, forming a water tight closure. The stabilization stitch is removed. The repair is now complete. The ports are removed and the port sites are closed with dissolvable sutures. The amniotic fluid we removed is now replaced with warm fluid, and antibiotics are placed into the amniotic cavity. Finally, we close the mother\u2019s abdominal wall muscle, and then close the skin. Ideally, the pregnancy continues until term, at which point the baby is delivered vaginally if there is no contraindication."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

You almost kind of forget sometimes. - When I was thinking about him taking those first steps and you know, he would go a couple steps then fall into us and he was laughing because we were laughing 'cause we were really celebrating that he was able to do that. Nobody was really sure what was gonna happen. And then now, years later as he's three years old, everybody is so surprised to see how well he's doing. - From all around the world, people come and all around the country, people come to UC Davis to have surgical procedures and to have medical care. We made the right choice. I think it's very obvious to us that we made the right choice at the right hospital with the right doctors."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Unbearable. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. He had to live with this pain all the time. This YouTube video is not easy to watch. Munim Fershishi was born in Algiers with a severe form of spina bifida. His spinal cord did not close and his nerves that control walking and other functions pushed out into a sac of fluid called a meningocele. He could not walk or even sit. His mother Salima says her son spent the first two years of his life tilted forward on his stomach. He was in pain and doctors didn't do anything. Then the sac on Munim's back broke. He developed meningitis and slipped into a coma. His eyes were closed and he was breathing through a tube. Doctors in Algiers operated on Munim, but it did not help. Then, thanks to donations from the community, Munim was transported to Mayo Clinic. Probably the only reason the child survived, truthfully, for two years was due to the tremendous, obvious love and energy of the mother and the family. Neurosurgeon Frederick Meyer teamed up with other specialists in plastic surgery and pediatrics to customize a treatment plan for Munim. First, they cleared his body of infections. Then, Dr. Meyer opened the skin covering on Munim's spine and put the exposed nerve roots back into the spinal canal. Then, he closed the spinal canal and plastic surgeons closed the skin. No one was sure how Munim would do after surgery. He can move his feet, he moves his legs, he can sit down, he can eat with his own hand. Salima says Munim is without pain. He can play and laugh for the first time. Physical therapists are helping Munim get stronger and walk better than expected. Doctors aren't sure how far Munim will go with physical therapy, whether or not he'll be able to walk unassisted. But now, there's a promise of a full, productive life. He's my life. Munim is only two and a half, but he says when he grows up, he wants to be a surgeon, like Dr. Meyer.

But some children in other countries aren't so lucky. A little boy from Algeria suffered terribly for more than two years until his community helped raise money to send him to Mayo Clinic. Unbearable. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. He had to live with this pain all the time. This YouTube video is not easy to watch. Munim Fershishi was born in Algiers with a severe form of spina bifida. His spinal cord did not close and his nerves that control walking and other functions pushed out into a sac of fluid called a meningocele. He could not walk or even sit. His mother Salima says her son spent the first two years of his life tilted forward on his stomach. He was in pain and doctors didn't do anything. Then the sac on Munim's back broke. He developed meningitis and slipped into a coma. His eyes were closed and he was breathing through a tube. Doctors in Algiers operated on Munim, but it did not help. Then, thanks to donations from the community, Munim was transported to Mayo Clinic. Probably the only reason the child survived, truthfully, for two years was due to the tremendous, obvious love and energy of the mother and the family. Neurosurgeon Frederick Meyer teamed up with other specialists in plastic surgery and pediatrics to customize a treatment plan for Munim. First, they cleared his body of infections. Then, Dr. Meyer opened the skin covering on Munim's spine and put the exposed nerve roots back into the spinal canal. Then, he closed the spinal canal and plastic surgeons closed the skin. No one was sure how Munim would do after surgery. He can move his feet, he moves his legs, he can sit down, he can eat with his own hand. Salima says Munim is without pain. He can play and laugh for the first time. Physical therapists are helping Munim get stronger and walk better than expected.

I mean, not that I would, but I didn't feel an different being pregnant, I didn't have any suspicion whatsoever. Spina bifida is so different in the way that it affects each child, so even when you're researching, you have so many possible outcomes.  It was nice that we actually had genetic counseling at that time, but to a certain regard, you kinda feel like you're on an island by yourself at that point. And we were looking for someone to really help us become grounded and know where we were gonna be going in the future.  Doctor Baschat: It's a 4D probe phase.  Doctor Miller: Here, at Johns Hopkins, we put together a new, innovative approach for prenatal surgery for spina bifida, which is much less invasive for the mother.  When you do traditional open fetal spina bifida repair, you also open the uterus with an incision, and that happens in the most vulnerable part of the uterine muscle. Whereas, if you do a fetoscopic repair, then your access to the fetus is minimally invasive and that averts a lot of problems of open fetal surgery.  And gives the opportunity to have a lesser impact, not only on the current pregnancy, but for every future pregnancy that she may have or consider, as well.  So, in cases of spina bifida, the three most common neurological findings are hydrocephalus, which is pressure on the brain, Chiari malformation, and the spina bifida lesion itself. It's important that we address those, and through prenatal closure, we're able to reduce the rates of both hydrocephalus and Chiari very successfully. Here at Hopkins, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I'm involved as one of the first team members that they meet, as part of the fetal therapy team, and I help take care of their child throughout the course of their life.  They really talked about not just the pregnancy and not just the surgery, but then what care would look like for Harper down the line.  The benefits of prenatal surgery for spina bifida are established. When you compare the group of children that have surgery before, fewer children will require a shunt for hydrocephalus after birth. Their motor function will also be improved. We anticipate that after the immediate post-operative period, for women who, their course has been uncomplicated, they can gradually return back towards their normal activity.

Doctor Miller: Here, at Johns Hopkins, we put together a new, innovative approach for prenatal surgery for spina bifida, which is much less invasive for the mother.  When you do traditional open fetal spina bifida repair, you also open the uterus with an incision, and that happens in the most vulnerable part of the uterine muscle. Whereas, if you do a fetoscopic repair, then your access to the fetus is minimally invasive and that averts a lot of problems of open fetal surgery.  And gives the opportunity to have a lesser impact, not only on the current pregnancy, but for every future pregnancy that she may have or consider, as well.  So, in cases of spina bifida, the three most common neurological findings are hydrocephalus, which is pressure on the brain, Chiari malformation, and the spina bifida lesion itself. It's important that we address those, and through prenatal closure, we're able to reduce the rates of both hydrocephalus and Chiari very successfully. Here at Hopkins, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I'm involved as one of the first team members that they meet, as part of the fetal therapy team, and I help take care of their child throughout the course of their life.  They really talked about not just the pregnancy and not just the surgery, but then what care would look like for Harper down the line.  The benefits of prenatal surgery for spina bifida are established. When you compare the group of children that have surgery before, fewer children will require a shunt for hydrocephalus after birth. Their motor function will also be improved. We anticipate that after the immediate post-operative period, for women who, their course has been uncomplicated, they can gradually return back towards their normal activity. And that is a major advantage for life.  The idea that I also got to have a vaginal delivery was really, really important to me. My recovery was pretty easy after she was born and that made a huge difference in my ability to be there for her and for my other kids.  Doctor Miller: Because we have such a small core team who's involved in the total care of these patients, any small change, we can observe immediately.

I mean, not that I would, but I didn't feel an different being pregnant, I didn't have any suspicion whatsoever. Spina bifida is so different in the way that it affects each child, so even when you're researching, you have so many possible outcomes.  It was nice that we actually had genetic counseling at that time, but to a certain regard, you kinda feel like you're on an island by yourself at that point. And we were looking for someone to really help us become grounded and know where we were gonna be going in the future.  Doctor Baschat: It's a 4D probe phase.  Doctor Miller: Here, at Johns Hopkins, we put together a new, innovative approach for prenatal surgery for spina bifida, which is much less invasive for the mother.  When you do traditional open fetal spina bifida repair, you also open the uterus with an incision, and that happens in the most vulnerable part of the uterine muscle. Whereas, if you do a fetoscopic repair, then your access to the fetus is minimally invasive and that averts a lot of problems of open fetal surgery.  And gives the opportunity to have a lesser impact, not only on the current pregnancy, but for every future pregnancy that she may have or consider, as well.  So, in cases of spina bifida, the three most common neurological findings are hydrocephalus, which is pressure on the brain, Chiari malformation, and the spina bifida lesion itself. It's important that we address those, and through prenatal closure, we're able to reduce the rates of both hydrocephalus and Chiari very successfully. Here at Hopkins, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I'm involved as one of the first team members that they meet, as part of the fetal therapy team, and I help take care of their child throughout the course of their life.  They really talked about not just the pregnancy and not just the surgery, but then what care would look like for Harper down the line.  The benefits of prenatal surgery for spina bifida are established. When you compare the group of children that have surgery before, fewer children will require a shunt for hydrocephalus after birth. Their motor function will also be improved. We anticipate that after the immediate post-operative period, for women who, their course has been uncomplicated, they can gradually return back towards their normal activity. And that is a major advantage for life.  The idea that I also got to have a vaginal delivery was really, really important to me. My recovery was pretty easy after she was born and that made a huge difference in my ability to be there for her and for my other kids.  Doctor Miller: Because we have such a small core team who's involved in the total care of these patients, any small change, we can observe immediately.  We have regular followup appointments with a lot of doctors, but that's okay. We see neurosurgery every three months, just to keep checking on things and making sure things are going well.  Scott: From her health and the baby's health, we couldn't have asked for anything better from that surgery.  Fetal surgery is hard. It's not an easy decision to make.
