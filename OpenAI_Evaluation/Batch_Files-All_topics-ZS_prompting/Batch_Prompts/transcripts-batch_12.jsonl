The main aim of my making this video is to raise awareness about this condition, not only amongst the patients but also amongst the medical fraternity. Hi I'm Dr. Amod Manocha. I'm a pain specialist and I work at the Max Hospital in Delhi as the head of the pain management services. Let me describe a typical patient who presents to my clinic with this problem. So most patients who present to my clinic would be young or middle aged male or female patients with pelvic pain. Before they come to my clinic they have normally seen numerous specialists which may include neurologists, general surgeons, neurologists, gynecologists and often internal medicine specialists. They've had numerous investigations but despite that no cause can be found which can explain their pain symptoms. And often their life is at a standstill because it affects not only their working capacity but also their sitting ability and their sexual life. These patients have normally done a lot of internet research before they can come to the diagnosis or come to the suspicion that pudendal nerve might be the problem in their case. So let me describe the symptoms which these patients present. So the main presenting complaint is pelvic pain which may feel like a burning, shooting, aching sensation and this may be located in the genital area such as the penis or the scrotum or the vagina or the labia or the perineal area. The perineal area is the area high up in between the two legs. The pain may also be located close to the sit bones and often it goes down on the inner side of the leg. Now this pain is associated with urinary symptoms and most patients describe it as if they have got a urinary infection which means they say they have to go to pass urine more often. There is often pain while they are passing urine accompanied by a burning sensation. Along with this they may have bowel symptoms or stool symptoms such as increased urge to open bowels, irritation or itching sensation around the area when they are passing stool or even pain when they are passing stool. Along with this one of the other major symptoms is sexual dysfunction which means they have pain when they are aroused, when they are having intercourse or when they are having an orgasm. They can in males especially, there can be pain after ejaculation as well and you can understand the implications of this and how this can affect the life of people. Before we move any further I think it is important to know a little bit more about the pudendal nerve. So pudendal nerve is one of the major nerves in the pelvis and there is one on each side. Now this nerve has an important role in controlling the urine and the stool control and it also carries the sensation to the genital area. So let me explain you a little bit more with the help of this animation model. So if I remove the skin and the muscles and the yellow ones you see are the nerves. Now the one which I have highlighted is the pudendal nerve and you can appreciate that it comes out of the spine and travels towards the front. If I rotate the spine then you can see this clearly and this nerve which you see is the pudendal nerve. Now to help you understand and appreciate it a little bit more let me isolate the nerve. So what you see now is the pudendal nerve coming out of the spine and then travelling forwards and during its course it will give different branches which will go to different areas like the rectal area, the genital area and the perineal area. So if I put the skin back then you will be able to appreciate where this nerve is located and what's its course. Let's move further and talk about what can cause the pudendal neuralgia symptoms. So any pressure on the nerve as while cycling or bike riding or prolonged sitting can lead to the appearance of the typical symptoms and often for this reason this condition is also known as the Cyclist's Syndrome. Training of the nerve as during childbirth can also lead to the typical symptoms. Other causes of pudendal neuralgia can include injury to the nerve as well as a surgery or a trauma or infections in the area such as herpes. Now this condition can be quite challenging to diagnose and what we sometimes use is special MRI scans to look at these nerves. Depending on the availability we may also use nerve conduction tests and these are special tests but what can help us diagnose with a little bit more confidence is diagnostic nerve blocks. So if we numb these nerves with the help of injections and the pain goes away then that can be a clue to the diagnosis. So for treating this condition what we use is a multidisciplinary approach which means we use different modalities together to try and give you the maximum benefit from it. We have to undertake some lifestyle modifications which are aimed at protecting the nerve giving it an opportunity to heal. Now these lifestyle modifications include using a special cushion while we are sitting, avoiding tight throats to avoid pressure on the nerve, avoiding constipation so that the nerve does not get further damaged, avoiding things like bike riding, avoiding things like horse riding and prolonged sitting. Along with this what we use is physiotherapy aimed at specifically the pelvic floor muscles. We also use medications which are special type of medications which works on the nerves and are called neuropathic medications. Now these medications can take some time to produce their effect and often we have to start with the lower dose and then gradually increase the dose till you get the benefits from it. Another important modality what we use in the treatment is injections. We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them. Thank you once again."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

So let me explain you a little bit more with the help of this animation model. So if I remove the skin and the muscles and the yellow ones you see are the nerves. Now the one which I have highlighted is the pudendal nerve and you can appreciate that it comes out of the spine and travels towards the front. If I rotate the spine then you can see this clearly and this nerve which you see is the pudendal nerve. Now to help you understand and appreciate it a little bit more let me isolate the nerve. So what you see now is the pudendal nerve coming out of the spine and then travelling forwards and during its course it will give different branches which will go to different areas like the rectal area, the genital area and the perineal area. So if I put the skin back then you will be able to appreciate where this nerve is located and what's its course. Let's move further and talk about what can cause the pudendal neuralgia symptoms. So any pressure on the nerve as while cycling or bike riding or prolonged sitting can lead to the appearance of the typical symptoms and often for this reason this condition is also known as the Cyclist's Syndrome. Training of the nerve as during childbirth can also lead to the typical symptoms. Other causes of pudendal neuralgia can include injury to the nerve as well as a surgery or a trauma or infections in the area such as herpes. Now this condition can be quite challenging to diagnose and what we sometimes use is special MRI scans to look at these nerves. Depending on the availability we may also use nerve conduction tests and these are special tests but what can help us diagnose with a little bit more confidence is diagnostic nerve blocks. So if we numb these nerves with the help of injections and the pain goes away then that can be a clue to the diagnosis. So for treating this condition what we use is a multidisciplinary approach which means we use different modalities together to try and give you the maximum benefit from it. We have to undertake some lifestyle modifications which are aimed at protecting the nerve giving it an opportunity to heal. Now these lifestyle modifications include using a special cushion while we are sitting, avoiding tight throats to avoid pressure on the nerve, avoiding constipation so that the nerve does not get further damaged, avoiding things like bike riding, avoiding things like horse riding and prolonged sitting. Along with this what we use is physiotherapy aimed at specifically the pelvic floor muscles. We also use medications which are special type of medications which works on the nerves and are called neuropathic medications. Now these medications can take some time to produce their effect and often we have to start with the lower dose and then gradually increase the dose till you get the benefits from it. Another important modality what we use in the treatment is injections. We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them.

The main aim of my making this video is to raise awareness about this condition, not only amongst the patients but also amongst the medical fraternity. Hi I'm Dr. Amod Manocha. I'm a pain specialist and I work at the Max Hospital in Delhi as the head of the pain management services. Let me describe a typical patient who presents to my clinic with this problem. So most patients who present to my clinic would be young or middle aged male or female patients with pelvic pain. Before they come to my clinic they have normally seen numerous specialists which may include neurologists, general surgeons, neurologists, gynecologists and often internal medicine specialists. They've had numerous investigations but despite that no cause can be found which can explain their pain symptoms. And often their life is at a standstill because it affects not only their working capacity but also their sitting ability and their sexual life. These patients have normally done a lot of internet research before they can come to the diagnosis or come to the suspicion that pudendal nerve might be the problem in their case. So let me describe the symptoms which these patients present. So the main presenting complaint is pelvic pain which may feel like a burning, shooting, aching sensation and this may be located in the genital area such as the penis or the scrotum or the vagina or the labia or the perineal area. The perineal area is the area high up in between the two legs. The pain may also be located close to the sit bones and often it goes down on the inner side of the leg. Now this pain is associated with urinary symptoms and most patients describe it as if they have got a urinary infection which means they say they have to go to pass urine more often. There is often pain while they are passing urine accompanied by a burning sensation. Along with this they may have bowel symptoms or stool symptoms such as increased urge to open bowels, irritation or itching sensation around the area when they are passing stool or even pain when they are passing stool. Along with this one of the other major symptoms is sexual dysfunction which means they have pain when they are aroused, when they are having intercourse or when they are having an orgasm. They can in males especially, there can be pain after ejaculation as well and you can understand the implications of this and how this can affect the life of people.

Now the one which I have highlighted is the pudendal nerve and you can appreciate that it comes out of the spine and travels towards the front. If I rotate the spine then you can see this clearly and this nerve which you see is the pudendal nerve. Now to help you understand and appreciate it a little bit more let me isolate the nerve. So what you see now is the pudendal nerve coming out of the spine and then travelling forwards and during its course it will give different branches which will go to different areas like the rectal area, the genital area and the perineal area. So if I put the skin back then you will be able to appreciate where this nerve is located and what's its course. Let's move further and talk about what can cause the pudendal neuralgia symptoms. So any pressure on the nerve as while cycling or bike riding or prolonged sitting can lead to the appearance of the typical symptoms and often for this reason this condition is also known as the Cyclist's Syndrome. Training of the nerve as during childbirth can also lead to the typical symptoms. Other causes of pudendal neuralgia can include injury to the nerve as well as a surgery or a trauma or infections in the area such as herpes. Now this condition can be quite challenging to diagnose and what we sometimes use is special MRI scans to look at these nerves. Depending on the availability we may also use nerve conduction tests and these are special tests but what can help us diagnose with a little bit more confidence is diagnostic nerve blocks. So if we numb these nerves with the help of injections and the pain goes away then that can be a clue to the diagnosis. So for treating this condition what we use is a multidisciplinary approach which means we use different modalities together to try and give you the maximum benefit from it. We have to undertake some lifestyle modifications which are aimed at protecting the nerve giving it an opportunity to heal. Now these lifestyle modifications include using a special cushion while we are sitting, avoiding tight throats to avoid pressure on the nerve, avoiding constipation so that the nerve does not get further damaged, avoiding things like bike riding, avoiding things like horse riding and prolonged sitting. Along with this what we use is physiotherapy aimed at specifically the pelvic floor muscles. We also use medications which are special type of medications which works on the nerves and are called neuropathic medications. Now these medications can take some time to produce their effect and often we have to start with the lower dose and then gradually increase the dose till you get the benefits from it. Another important modality what we use in the treatment is injections. We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them.

The main aim of my making this video is to raise awareness about this condition, not only amongst the patients but also amongst the medical fraternity. Hi I'm Dr. Amod Manocha. I'm a pain specialist and I work at the Max Hospital in Delhi as the head of the pain management services. Let me describe a typical patient who presents to my clinic with this problem. So most patients who present to my clinic would be young or middle aged male or female patients with pelvic pain. Before they come to my clinic they have normally seen numerous specialists which may include neurologists, general surgeons, neurologists, gynecologists and often internal medicine specialists. They've had numerous investigations but despite that no cause can be found which can explain their pain symptoms. And often their life is at a standstill because it affects not only their working capacity but also their sitting ability and their sexual life. These patients have normally done a lot of internet research before they can come to the diagnosis or come to the suspicion that pudendal nerve might be the problem in their case. So let me describe the symptoms which these patients present. So the main presenting complaint is pelvic pain which may feel like a burning, shooting, aching sensation and this may be located in the genital area such as the penis or the scrotum or the vagina or the labia or the perineal area. The perineal area is the area high up in between the two legs. The pain may also be located close to the sit bones and often it goes down on the inner side of the leg. Now this pain is associated with urinary symptoms and most patients describe it as if they have got a urinary infection which means they say they have to go to pass urine more often. There is often pain while they are passing urine accompanied by a burning sensation. Along with this they may have bowel symptoms or stool symptoms such as increased urge to open bowels, irritation or itching sensation around the area when they are passing stool or even pain when they are passing stool. Along with this one of the other major symptoms is sexual dysfunction which means they have pain when they are aroused, when they are having intercourse or when they are having an orgasm. They can in males especially, there can be pain after ejaculation as well and you can understand the implications of this and how this can affect the life of people. Before we move any further I think it is important to know a little bit more about the pudendal nerve. So pudendal nerve is one of the major nerves in the pelvis and there is one on each side.

So what you see now is the pudendal nerve coming out of the spine and then travelling forwards and during its course it will give different branches which will go to different areas like the rectal area, the genital area and the perineal area. So if I put the skin back then you will be able to appreciate where this nerve is located and what's its course. Let's move further and talk about what can cause the pudendal neuralgia symptoms. So any pressure on the nerve as while cycling or bike riding or prolonged sitting can lead to the appearance of the typical symptoms and often for this reason this condition is also known as the Cyclist's Syndrome. Training of the nerve as during childbirth can also lead to the typical symptoms. Other causes of pudendal neuralgia can include injury to the nerve as well as a surgery or a trauma or infections in the area such as herpes. Now this condition can be quite challenging to diagnose and what we sometimes use is special MRI scans to look at these nerves. Depending on the availability we may also use nerve conduction tests and these are special tests but what can help us diagnose with a little bit more confidence is diagnostic nerve blocks. So if we numb these nerves with the help of injections and the pain goes away then that can be a clue to the diagnosis. So for treating this condition what we use is a multidisciplinary approach which means we use different modalities together to try and give you the maximum benefit from it. We have to undertake some lifestyle modifications which are aimed at protecting the nerve giving it an opportunity to heal. Now these lifestyle modifications include using a special cushion while we are sitting, avoiding tight throats to avoid pressure on the nerve, avoiding constipation so that the nerve does not get further damaged, avoiding things like bike riding, avoiding things like horse riding and prolonged sitting. Along with this what we use is physiotherapy aimed at specifically the pelvic floor muscles. We also use medications which are special type of medications which works on the nerves and are called neuropathic medications. Now these medications can take some time to produce their effect and often we have to start with the lower dose and then gradually increase the dose till you get the benefits from it. Another important modality what we use in the treatment is injections. We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them. Thank you once again."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

The main aim of my making this video is to raise awareness about this condition, not only amongst the patients but also amongst the medical fraternity. Hi I'm Dr. Amod Manocha. I'm a pain specialist and I work at the Max Hospital in Delhi as the head of the pain management services. Let me describe a typical patient who presents to my clinic with this problem. So most patients who present to my clinic would be young or middle aged male or female patients with pelvic pain. Before they come to my clinic they have normally seen numerous specialists which may include neurologists, general surgeons, neurologists, gynecologists and often internal medicine specialists. They've had numerous investigations but despite that no cause can be found which can explain their pain symptoms. And often their life is at a standstill because it affects not only their working capacity but also their sitting ability and their sexual life. These patients have normally done a lot of internet research before they can come to the diagnosis or come to the suspicion that pudendal nerve might be the problem in their case. So let me describe the symptoms which these patients present. So the main presenting complaint is pelvic pain which may feel like a burning, shooting, aching sensation and this may be located in the genital area such as the penis or the scrotum or the vagina or the labia or the perineal area. The perineal area is the area high up in between the two legs. The pain may also be located close to the sit bones and often it goes down on the inner side of the leg. Now this pain is associated with urinary symptoms and most patients describe it as if they have got a urinary infection which means they say they have to go to pass urine more often. There is often pain while they are passing urine accompanied by a burning sensation. Along with this they may have bowel symptoms or stool symptoms such as increased urge to open bowels, irritation or itching sensation around the area when they are passing stool or even pain when they are passing stool. Along with this one of the other major symptoms is sexual dysfunction which means they have pain when they are aroused, when they are having intercourse or when they are having an orgasm. They can in males especially, there can be pain after ejaculation as well and you can understand the implications of this and how this can affect the life of people. Before we move any further I think it is important to know a little bit more about the pudendal nerve. So pudendal nerve is one of the major nerves in the pelvis and there is one on each side. Now this nerve has an important role in controlling the urine and the stool control and it also carries the sensation to the genital area. So let me explain you a little bit more with the help of this animation model. So if I remove the skin and the muscles and the yellow ones you see are the nerves.

And you're watching Demystifying the Pelvic Floor, weekly videos providing real and simplified pelvic floor education for real clinical situations. We've got you covered. And today we'll be talking about pudendal neuralgia and why you should consider the pelvic floor muscles. What is the pudendal nerve and what is pudendal neuralgia? So the pudendal nerve, as you can see from this photo, runs on bilateral sides of the pelvic floor muscles and innervates the clitoris, perineum, labia, and anal sphincter. The pudendal nerve can become compressed, irritated, inflamed, which can lead to neuralgia of that nerve. It's a subset of vulvodynia and it can cause pain in the nerve distribution. This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after. Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve. And if it reproduces the patient's symptoms or creates a zinging and a referral into the distribution of the nerve, then that's considered what we call a positive Tenel sign or a neuropathic irritation that could be causing some of the patient's symptoms. So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

The pudendal nerve can become compressed, irritated, inflamed, which can lead to neuralgia of that nerve. It's a subset of vulvodynia and it can cause pain in the nerve distribution. This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after. Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve. And if it reproduces the patient's symptoms or creates a zinging and a referral into the distribution of the nerve, then that's considered what we call a positive Tenel sign or a neuropathic irritation that could be causing some of the patient's symptoms. So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve. And if it reproduces the patient's symptoms or creates a zinging and a referral into the distribution of the nerve, then that's considered what we call a positive Tenel sign or a neuropathic irritation that could be causing some of the patient's symptoms. So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

And you're watching Demystifying the Pelvic Floor, weekly videos providing real and simplified pelvic floor education for real clinical situations. We've got you covered. And today we'll be talking about pudendal neuralgia and why you should consider the pelvic floor muscles. What is the pudendal nerve and what is pudendal neuralgia? So the pudendal nerve, as you can see from this photo, runs on bilateral sides of the pelvic floor muscles and innervates the clitoris, perineum, labia, and anal sphincter. The pudendal nerve can become compressed, irritated, inflamed, which can lead to neuralgia of that nerve. It's a subset of vulvodynia and it can cause pain in the nerve distribution. This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after.

I'm a surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Reconstruction and I specialize in the microsurgery of nerves. Pedendal neuralgia is a compression of the pedendal nerve. So what that amounts to is the pedendal nerve is in someone's pelvis. It's the nerve that goes to their genitalia, to their perineum, to the anus, that whole entire area down there. And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed.

I'm a surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Reconstruction and I specialize in the microsurgery of nerves. Pedendal neuralgia is a compression of the pedendal nerve. So what that amounts to is the pedendal nerve is in someone's pelvis. It's the nerve that goes to their genitalia, to their perineum, to the anus, that whole entire area down there. And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed.

If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed.

Tip of the spinal needle should be 1.5 to 2 cm longer than Iova Trampet. Prior to performing pudendal nerve block we need to identify ischial spine first. Two fingers are introduced in vagina and then on the lateral vaginal wall there is a prominent which is ischial spine and if you gently push on this it will cause discomfort with patient. Ischial spine is marked with a pink marker on the side wall. Local anesthetic and spinal needles are ready. Iova Trampet for patient right side is mounted on the right hand of the surgeon with the opening on the top and tip of Iova Trampet is between two fingers.

Tip of the trumpet needle is pointed at the ischial spine, moved 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and pushed gently against vaginal mucosa. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet until resistance is met. For the teaching purposes this is how long is tip of the needle outside Iova Trampet. The needle is further introduced 1.5 to 2 cm into tissue around pudendal nerve with an aspirated syringe to confirm there is no intravascular placement and then solution is then injected.

Sterile gloves, mucus, povidone iodine or stanchaxidine, 10 cc controlled syringe, Iova Trampet, 20 gauge 15 cm spinal needle, regular spinal needle for transpirinal approach, 1% local anesthetic. Prior to doing pudendal nerve block you would like to be sure that the spinal needle is appropriate length. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet. Tip of the spinal needle should be 1.5 to 2 cm longer than Iova Trampet. Prior to performing pudendal nerve block we need to identify ischial spine first. Two fingers are introduced in vagina and then on the lateral vaginal wall there is a prominent which is ischial spine and if you gently push on this it will cause discomfort with patient. Ischial spine is marked with a pink marker on the side wall. Local anesthetic and spinal needles are ready. Iova Trampet for patient right side is mounted on the right hand of the surgeon with the opening on the top and tip of Iova Trampet is between two fingers.

Tip of the spinal needle should be 1.5 to 2 cm longer than Iova Trampet. Prior to performing pudendal nerve block we need to identify ischial spine first. Two fingers are introduced in vagina and then on the lateral vaginal wall there is a prominent which is ischial spine and if you gently push on this it will cause discomfort with patient. Ischial spine is marked with a pink marker on the side wall. Local anesthetic and spinal needles are ready. Iova Trampet for patient right side is mounted on the right hand of the surgeon with the opening on the top and tip of Iova Trampet is between two fingers. After placing lots of mucus, fingers are gently placed into vagina. After we identify ischial spine, trumpet needle is introduced. Tip of the trumpet needle is pointed at the ischial spine, moved 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and pushed gently against vaginal mucosa. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet until resistance is met. For the teaching purposes this is how long is tip of the needle outside Iova Trampet. The needle is further introduced 1.5 to 2 cm into tissue around pudendal nerve with an aspirated syringe to confirm there is no intravascular placement and then solution is then injected. Following injection spinal needle is slowly withdrawn leaving Iova Trampet in place and then Iova Trampet is removed slowly. I just injected 10cc of ampersand xylocaine to patient's right side. Now we are going to switch the side. Iova Trampet is placed in surgeon's left hand. Iova Trampet is introduced in vagina. Left ischial spine is found. Tip is placed 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and 10cc of ampersand xylocaine is injected again. Pudendal nerve block is now complete. You should wait 5 minutes and check how effective is your block."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Your anesthesiologist is a doctor who specializes in the relief of pain and administering anesthesia to patients having surgery. A nerve block is a type of anesthesia where the anesthesiologist injects numbing medication around a nerve or nerve bundle which will block the feeling of pain in part of your body. The nerve block may also cause weakness in the same area. Right before your surgery, your anesthesiologist will discuss the nerve block with you and answer any questions you may have. The nerve block is usually done right before your surgery. It may be performed in a special area or in the operating room. Your team will place monitors to watch your vital signs and give you extra oxygen to breathe during the procedure. Before beginning your nerve block, your anesthesia doctor will go through a safety checklist to confirm the right procedure is being done on the right patient. Once you have been placed in the proper position, your anesthesia doctor will be ready to begin the nerve block. Placing the nerve block will usually take 5 to 15 minutes. It will take longer if your doctor is placing a nerve block catheter. As your doctor begins the procedure, they may give you a small amount of medicine through your IV to help you relax during the procedure. The medicine will not knock you out. It is important for you to be awake during the nerve block so that you can follow any instructions and let the doctor know if you are feeling any pain or discomfort during the process. The next step is for your doctor to clean the area where the block will be placed with an antibacterial soap. Most nerves are just a few inches beneath the skin. Your doctor may use a special machine that uses sound waves to identify the nerve. Once the nerve has been located, the actual nerve block can begin. Your doctor will place a small amount of numbing medicine at the skin. Once your doctor has located the nerve with the ultrasound machine, they will then place a small blunt needle right next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort, such as sharp or shooting pain. This will allow your doctor to adjust the location of the needle. Once the needle is properly positioned, the doctor will inject numbing medicine next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort during the injection, ringing in your ears, a metal taste in your mouth, feeling dizzy, or anything else unusual. This may be due to problems with the injection. Once the nerve block is finished, many patients may feel the nerve block beginning to work after only a few minutes. It may take up to 45 minutes for the nerve block to reach its maximum effect. You may feel a numbness or tingling sensation, or even weakness in the muscles of the body part where the nerve block was placed as it begins to work. Certain surgeries may have strong pain for several days. Because a single injection of numbing medicine with a nerve block only lasts 8 to 24 hours after it is placed, you and your anesthesia doctor may decide that it would be best for you to have a nerve block catheter. A nerve block catheter is a very small tube, about the size of fishing line. It is placed through the needle so that it is next to your nerve. Numbing medicine may be given through the tubing for several days to make your nerve block last longer. Once the nerve block catheter is properly placed, the needle will be removed. Your doctor will use tape and other bandages to hold the catheter in place. They will inject the catheter with numbing medicine and ask you how you were feeling to help them detect any problems with the injection. After the first numbing medicine is injected, your doctor will hook up your catheter to a pump, which can drip a small amount of numbing medicine around the nerves for several days."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Your doctor may use a special machine that uses sound waves to identify the nerve. Once the nerve has been located, the actual nerve block can begin. Your doctor will place a small amount of numbing medicine at the skin. Once your doctor has located the nerve with the ultrasound machine, they will then place a small blunt needle right next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort, such as sharp or shooting pain. This will allow your doctor to adjust the location of the needle. Once the needle is properly positioned, the doctor will inject numbing medicine next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort during the injection, ringing in your ears, a metal taste in your mouth, feeling dizzy, or anything else unusual. This may be due to problems with the injection. Once the nerve block is finished, many patients may feel the nerve block beginning to work after only a few minutes. It may take up to 45 minutes for the nerve block to reach its maximum effect. You may feel a numbness or tingling sensation, or even weakness in the muscles of the body part where the nerve block was placed as it begins to work. Certain surgeries may have strong pain for several days. Because a single injection of numbing medicine with a nerve block only lasts 8 to 24 hours after it is placed, you and your anesthesia doctor may decide that it would be best for you to have a nerve block catheter. A nerve block catheter is a very small tube, about the size of fishing line. It is placed through the needle so that it is next to your nerve. Numbing medicine may be given through the tubing for several days to make your nerve block last longer. Once the nerve block catheter is properly placed, the needle will be removed. Your doctor will use tape and other bandages to hold the catheter in place. They will inject the catheter with numbing medicine and ask you how you were feeling to help them detect any problems with the injection. After the first numbing medicine is injected, your doctor will hook up your catheter to a pump, which can drip a small amount of numbing medicine around the nerves for several days."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Parineum is the space between the anus and scrotum in male or between the anus and vulva in female. It is also safe and effective for urological procedures including transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy, transurethral, prostatectomy, and catheter related bladder discomfort. Pudendal nerve is a mixed nerve both sensory and motor fibers mainly for the perineum and external genitalia in both sexes. It arises in the pelvic cavity from the sacral plexus S2 S4 leaves it through the greater sciatic foramen hooking around the ischial spine and enters the perineum through the lesser sciatic foramen. Procedure local anesthetic such as lidocaine or chloroprocaine is injected into the pudendal canal where the pudendal nerve is located. Lidocaine is usually preferred for this because it has a longer duration than chloroprocaine. It aims to block the nerve as it enters the lesser sciatic foramen one centimeter inferior and medial relative to the attachment of the sacros spinous ligament to the ischial spine.

Pudendal neuralgia is an important cause of chronic pelvic pain in both men and women and results from damage or irritation of the pudendal nerve. Pudendal nerve is one of the main nerves in the pelvis and originates from the sacral nerve roots. In the gluteal region, it runs between ligaments and close to the sciatic nerve before entering the Alcox canal. Pudendal nerve entrapment results from compression of the nerve during its course through the ligaments or the Alcox canal. Symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment include pain in buttocks and genital areas, pain in the back passage and lower abdominal pain. Pain is typically aggravated by sitting and relieved by standing upright. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, rehabilitative approach including pelvic floor exercises and injections. Dr Krishna is highly experienced in performing pudendal nerve blocks. The injection is performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. Dr Krishna will initially numb the skin with a numbing medicine. He will then use an ultrasound machine to guide the needle accurately close to the pudendal nerve. Dr Krishna will eventually inject a mixture of local anaesthetic and steroid around the pudendal nerve.

Today I am going to be presenting about laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release or pudendal entrapment syndrome. I have no conflict of interest. Pudendal nerves can be entrapped at different anatomical sites along with the pudendal artery. The two main entrapment locations remain between the sacrospinus and the sacrotuberous ligaments and the alcocanal. Pudendal nerve and artery entrapment is an underdiagnosed condition in clinical practice that causes mainly perineal pain and sexual dysfunction, but also urinary and rectal symptoms. Historically, and after failure of the conservative management, open invasive pudendal nerve decompression was done with poor outcomes and this is why the non-criteria which were put to standardize the diagnosis were very selective in order to minimize overtreatment by such an invasive approach. This was until the advent of laparoscopic pudendal release which allowed a minimally invasive surgery with an easy access and gentle blood-free dissection. This has therefore led to widening of surgical indications. The aim of our study was to assess the safety, feasibility and functional outcomes of laparoscopic transparitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release in patients with pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome with both a short and long-term follow-up. 235 patients with pudendal nerve entrapment were included in the study and they underwent laparoscopic transparitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release. Post-operative complications, according to the Clavian-Dendou classification, were recorded both on a short and long-term follow-up. Those are briefly the surgery steps. First, we developed the octorator space and we carried the dissection medially to the octorator vein. The coccygeous muscle fibers must be cut and released to have access to the ischial spine on which the surgeon's forceps pointing in Figure C. Finally, we arrived to the entry to the alcocanal. Here, we can clearly see the pudendal vein and artery entering the alcocanal. The pudendal nerve is lateral to the artery and not visible in the image. The goal of the surgery is to liberate the pudendal elements from the ischiatic spine to the alcocanal and transpose them medially. After assessing the post-operative outcomes in the total cohort, a prospective cohort of 32 patients was evaluated for functional outcomes before and at least 24 months after surgery. The main outcomes that were assessed are pernioidemia using visual analog scale, urinary symptoms using the urinary symptom profile, erectile function using the IIEF5, and bowel function using the patient assessment of constipation symptoms PAC-SYM score. The mean operative time per side was 33 minutes and the hospital length of stay was 2 days for the majority of patients. No significant blood loss and no serious clavian-dindo 3 and 4 post-operative complications were noted. Prenile or perineal paresthesia or hyperaesthesia was the most frequent post-operative complaint. However, it was transitory for 3 months after which all patients were free of symptoms. As for functional outcomes, perineal pain decreased significantly from a mean of VAS of 7 to a mean of 2. Erectile function improved significantly after surgery and we think it is most probably due to the artery entrapment since immediate results were seen after surgery. Constipation also decreased significantly after surgery. As for the urinary symptoms, improvement was only noted for the dysuria domain. No significant differences were found between before and after surgery or stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder symptoms. So to conclude, laparoscopic pudendal nerve and artery release is both a fast and safe surgery with promising functional outcomes on pudendal neuralgia, erectile function, lower urinary tract symptoms and constipation.

Here, we can clearly see the pudendal vein and artery entering the alcocanal. The pudendal nerve is lateral to the artery and not visible in the image. The goal of the surgery is to liberate the pudendal elements from the ischiatic spine to the alcocanal and transpose them medially. After assessing the post-operative outcomes in the total cohort, a prospective cohort of 32 patients was evaluated for functional outcomes before and at least 24 months after surgery. The main outcomes that were assessed are pernioidemia using visual analog scale, urinary symptoms using the urinary symptom profile, erectile function using the IIEF5, and bowel function using the patient assessment of constipation symptoms PAC-SYM score. The mean operative time per side was 33 minutes and the hospital length of stay was 2 days for the majority of patients. No significant blood loss and no serious clavian-dindo 3 and 4 post-operative complications were noted. Prenile or perineal paresthesia or hyperaesthesia was the most frequent post-operative complaint. However, it was transitory for 3 months after which all patients were free of symptoms. As for functional outcomes, perineal pain decreased significantly from a mean of VAS of 7 to a mean of 2. Erectile function improved significantly after surgery and we think it is most probably due to the artery entrapment since immediate results were seen after surgery. Constipation also decreased significantly after surgery. As for the urinary symptoms, improvement was only noted for the dysuria domain. No significant differences were found between before and after surgery or stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder symptoms. So to conclude, laparoscopic pudendal nerve and artery release is both a fast and safe surgery with promising functional outcomes on pudendal neuralgia, erectile function, lower urinary tract symptoms and constipation.

Our Dr. Karen Johnson tells us more in today's Focus on Health. After years of trying, Celeste Lip and her husband were ecstatic to finally have a baby girl. She's our miracle baby. As Celeste recovered from the pains of birth, she still experienced excruciating pain whenever she was sitting. She was frustrated by what was causing it. Usually with childbirth, it's actually the nerve being stretched between two ligaments, very broad, heavy ligaments. In cyclists, it's the same thing. Cyclists are very athletic, and the ligaments actually become enlarged, and the nerve becomes entrapped. Celeste finally learned she had pudendal nerve entrapment. This nerve sits between two ligaments just below the sacrum and provides control and sensation to the bladder, genitalia, and rectum. At first it started out just feeling like there was a knife blade caught inside, and now it just feels like the skin is, in addition, the skin is abraded. It feels like it should be bleeding. Celeste tried injections into the nerve to block the pain, but they weren't successful, so she decided to have a surgical procedure to correct it. We cut the ligaments, and we open up this little channel that it runs in deep in the pelvis and free the nerve up and then actually shift it into a new location where it's not under any tension at all. So if you're experiencing severe pain when sitting, you've seen many doctors and still aren't sure what's going on, you may have pudendal nerve entrapment. So discuss this option with your doctor. With today's focus on health, I'm Dr. Karen Johnson. Well, try to imagine this, living with pain so severe that you go from doctor to doctor and no one can help you. And imagine not being able to sit. It's no laughing matter. Medical reporter Kristi Meyer is here with a new treatment that's going to give some relief. The problem too with diagnosis are the pain is so severe most people can't sit, but it's embarrassing then when they go to the doctor, it's usually misdiagnosed. Gina Keisler was an avid cyclist until she took a rough fall off her bike. She landed on her bottom, causing an injury that began a decade of pain. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. Gina who lives in Indianapolis went to some 40 medical specialists before coming to Houston for a new surgery. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. Dr. Kenneth Rainey knows how bad her pain is. He had it too after being hit by a car as he rode his bicycle. The worst problem is that you can't sit and socially you're really restricted in what you can do. Your life resolves around sitting in the chair in the recliner so that you don't have pain. The injury causes the pudendal nerve which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs to be squeezed by ligaments. Rainey saw a dozen doctors before going to France for surgery. He then took a Houston team back for training. Went over and we spent two weeks there and we learned the French technique so that I could bring them back, French trained so that we can offer this to American patients. And it's not just cyclists that can have this kind of pain. It can happen to people who wrestle. It can happen after a fall if you're rollerblading or ice skating. And it can even occur after childbirth or after gynecological surgery. Gina came from Indianapolis for surgery. When they released the pressure on the nerve, she has a 60% chance of being cured. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. We hope this is the end in sight. After today's surgery, Gina may have immediate relief or it could take up to two years. For more information on pudendal pain, we've linked our website to Memorial Hermann's. The hospital's PNE team has treated 115 patients in less than two years. Almost all were misdiagnosed by other doctors. With today's health check, I'm Kristi Myers. From Houston's News Leader, this is 13 Eyewitness News, Live at 5. I'm Kristi Myers. Imagine not being able to sit because of the pain. How one young woman who was suicidal had her life turned around. That story coming up later on Live at 5. She suffered from unspeakable pain that prevented her from even sitting down. It would take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations. This is a saving place. 13's Kristi Myers with how she got the pain to stop. Well, a couple of weeks ago we told you about a young woman who had so much pain that she couldn't even sit down. In fact, she became suicidal. What happened was a bicycle fall first caused that pain, but after a decade she became desperate. So this is the story of how her life was changed. This was Gina Kiesler two weeks ago, in so much pain she couldn't sit down. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. The pain began when this long distance bicycle rider fell off and landed on her seat. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. She saw more than 40 medical specialists in Indiana before coming to Houston for a new surgery she prayed would help. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. It's a terribly disabling syndrome. People have a horrible burning pain in their bottom. The pudendal nerve, which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs, can get trapped or squeezed between ligaments. And we cut those ligaments, releasing the nerve. And then once we've done that, it takes time in most people for the nerve to recover. Surgeons at Memorial Hermann Southwest had to go to France to learn the surgery. I can have my vitality back, my personality, my energy, my zest for life. And this was Gina only three days after surgery. I really don't feel any of the deep aching or the burning sensations that I would have deep in my buttock area. And that's just really exciting.

Our Dr. Karen Johnson tells us more in today's Focus on Health. After years of trying, Celeste Lip and her husband were ecstatic to finally have a baby girl. She's our miracle baby. As Celeste recovered from the pains of birth, she still experienced excruciating pain whenever she was sitting. She was frustrated by what was causing it. Usually with childbirth, it's actually the nerve being stretched between two ligaments, very broad, heavy ligaments. In cyclists, it's the same thing. Cyclists are very athletic, and the ligaments actually become enlarged, and the nerve becomes entrapped. Celeste finally learned she had pudendal nerve entrapment. This nerve sits between two ligaments just below the sacrum and provides control and sensation to the bladder, genitalia, and rectum. At first it started out just feeling like there was a knife blade caught inside, and now it just feels like the skin is, in addition, the skin is abraded. It feels like it should be bleeding. Celeste tried injections into the nerve to block the pain, but they weren't successful, so she decided to have a surgical procedure to correct it. We cut the ligaments, and we open up this little channel that it runs in deep in the pelvis and free the nerve up and then actually shift it into a new location where it's not under any tension at all. So if you're experiencing severe pain when sitting, you've seen many doctors and still aren't sure what's going on, you may have pudendal nerve entrapment. So discuss this option with your doctor. With today's focus on health, I'm Dr. Karen Johnson. Well, try to imagine this, living with pain so severe that you go from doctor to doctor and no one can help you. And imagine not being able to sit. It's no laughing matter. Medical reporter Kristi Meyer is here with a new treatment that's going to give some relief. The problem too with diagnosis are the pain is so severe most people can't sit, but it's embarrassing then when they go to the doctor, it's usually misdiagnosed. Gina Keisler was an avid cyclist until she took a rough fall off her bike. She landed on her bottom, causing an injury that began a decade of pain. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. Gina who lives in Indianapolis went to some 40 medical specialists before coming to Houston for a new surgery. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. Dr. Kenneth Rainey knows how bad her pain is. He had it too after being hit by a car as he rode his bicycle. The worst problem is that you can't sit and socially you're really restricted in what you can do. Your life resolves around sitting in the chair in the recliner so that you don't have pain. The injury causes the pudendal nerve which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs to be squeezed by ligaments. Rainey saw a dozen doctors before going to France for surgery. He then took a Houston team back for training. Went over and we spent two weeks there and we learned the French technique so that I could bring them back, French trained so that we can offer this to American patients. And it's not just cyclists that can have this kind of pain. It can happen to people who wrestle. It can happen after a fall if you're rollerblading or ice skating. And it can even occur after childbirth or after gynecological surgery. Gina came from Indianapolis for surgery. When they released the pressure on the nerve, she has a 60% chance of being cured. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. We hope this is the end in sight. After today's surgery, Gina may have immediate relief or it could take up to two years. For more information on pudendal pain, we've linked our website to Memorial Hermann's. The hospital's PNE team has treated 115 patients in less than two years. Almost all were misdiagnosed by other doctors. With today's health check, I'm Kristi Myers. From Houston's News Leader, this is 13 Eyewitness News, Live at 5. I'm Kristi Myers. Imagine not being able to sit because of the pain. How one young woman who was suicidal had her life turned around. That story coming up later on Live at 5. She suffered from unspeakable pain that prevented her from even sitting down. It would take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations. This is a saving place. 13's Kristi Myers with how she got the pain to stop. Well, a couple of weeks ago we told you about a young woman who had so much pain that she couldn't even sit down. In fact, she became suicidal. What happened was a bicycle fall first caused that pain, but after a decade she became desperate. So this is the story of how her life was changed. This was Gina Kiesler two weeks ago, in so much pain she couldn't sit down. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. The pain began when this long distance bicycle rider fell off and landed on her seat. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. She saw more than 40 medical specialists in Indiana before coming to Houston for a new surgery she prayed would help. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. It's a terribly disabling syndrome. People have a horrible burning pain in their bottom. The pudendal nerve, which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs, can get trapped or squeezed between ligaments. And we cut those ligaments, releasing the nerve. And then once we've done that, it takes time in most people for the nerve to recover. Surgeons at Memorial Hermann Southwest had to go to France to learn the surgery. I can have my vitality back, my personality, my energy, my zest for life.

Our Dr. Karen Johnson tells us more in today's Focus on Health. After years of trying, Celeste Lip and her husband were ecstatic to finally have a baby girl. She's our miracle baby. As Celeste recovered from the pains of birth, she still experienced excruciating pain whenever she was sitting. She was frustrated by what was causing it. Usually with childbirth, it's actually the nerve being stretched between two ligaments, very broad, heavy ligaments. In cyclists, it's the same thing. Cyclists are very athletic, and the ligaments actually become enlarged, and the nerve becomes entrapped. Celeste finally learned she had pudendal nerve entrapment. This nerve sits between two ligaments just below the sacrum and provides control and sensation to the bladder, genitalia, and rectum. At first it started out just feeling like there was a knife blade caught inside, and now it just feels like the skin is, in addition, the skin is abraded. It feels like it should be bleeding. Celeste tried injections into the nerve to block the pain, but they weren't successful, so she decided to have a surgical procedure to correct it. We cut the ligaments, and we open up this little channel that it runs in deep in the pelvis and free the nerve up and then actually shift it into a new location where it's not under any tension at all. So if you're experiencing severe pain when sitting, you've seen many doctors and still aren't sure what's going on, you may have pudendal nerve entrapment. So discuss this option with your doctor. With today's focus on health, I'm Dr. Karen Johnson. Well, try to imagine this, living with pain so severe that you go from doctor to doctor and no one can help you. And imagine not being able to sit. It's no laughing matter. Medical reporter Kristi Meyer is here with a new treatment that's going to give some relief. The problem too with diagnosis are the pain is so severe most people can't sit, but it's embarrassing then when they go to the doctor, it's usually misdiagnosed. Gina Keisler was an avid cyclist until she took a rough fall off her bike. She landed on her bottom, causing an injury that began a decade of pain. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. Gina who lives in Indianapolis went to some 40 medical specialists before coming to Houston for a new surgery. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. Dr. Kenneth Rainey knows how bad her pain is. He had it too after being hit by a car as he rode his bicycle. The worst problem is that you can't sit and socially you're really restricted in what you can do. Your life resolves around sitting in the chair in the recliner so that you don't have pain. The injury causes the pudendal nerve which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs to be squeezed by ligaments. Rainey saw a dozen doctors before going to France for surgery. He then took a Houston team back for training. Went over and we spent two weeks there and we learned the French technique so that I could bring them back, French trained so that we can offer this to American patients. And it's not just cyclists that can have this kind of pain. It can happen to people who wrestle. It can happen after a fall if you're rollerblading or ice skating. And it can even occur after childbirth or after gynecological surgery. Gina came from Indianapolis for surgery. When they released the pressure on the nerve, she has a 60% chance of being cured. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. We hope this is the end in sight. After today's surgery, Gina may have immediate relief or it could take up to two years. For more information on pudendal pain, we've linked our website to Memorial Hermann's. The hospital's PNE team has treated 115 patients in less than two years. Almost all were misdiagnosed by other doctors. With today's health check, I'm Kristi Myers.

Well, a couple of weeks ago we told you about a young woman who had so much pain that she couldn't even sit down. In fact, she became suicidal.

Well, a couple of weeks ago we told you about a young woman who had so much pain that she couldn't even sit down. In fact, she became suicidal. What happened was a bicycle fall first caused that pain, but after a decade she became desperate. So this is the story of how her life was changed. This was Gina Kiesler two weeks ago, in so much pain she couldn't sit down. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. The pain began when this long distance bicycle rider fell off and landed on her seat. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. She saw more than 40 medical specialists in Indiana before coming to Houston for a new surgery she prayed would help. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. It's a terribly disabling syndrome. People have a horrible burning pain in their bottom. The pudendal nerve, which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs, can get trapped or squeezed between ligaments. And we cut those ligaments, releasing the nerve. And then once we've done that, it takes time in most people for the nerve to recover. Surgeons at Memorial Hermann Southwest had to go to France to learn the surgery. I can have my vitality back, my personality, my energy, my zest for life. And this was Gina only three days after surgery. I really don't feel any of the deep aching or the burning sensations that I would have deep in my buttock area. And that's just really exciting. Christy Myers, 13, Eyewitness News."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

The case is a 54 year old female. The background was two vaginal deliveries, two episodes of trauma over the coxis and repetition cystitis. For the last four years, she complains about dyspareunia and pain in the left vaginal and perianal region. The pain is worse with defecation and urination. The pain is very intense, 9 in the visual analogical scale and gets worse throughout the day and when sitting up. It's a pain in bed and allowing to sleep normally. Clinical findings, sensibility, research, intense pain when pressing the left ischial spine, pelvic MNR without pathological findings. See the guided pudendal block, positive diagnostic response. Based on Nantes criteria, the patient was diagnosed of left pudendal neuralgia and trait in the pain unit by neuromodulator drugs and radiofrequency following our protocol. The outcome was unsatisfactory, so the surgery was decided. The surgeon is placed in the side opposite to the nerve to be released. We usually use four truckers, three of five and one of ten millimeters. We are located in the left side of the pelvis and our first objective is locating both, the umbilical artery that is going to be our medial limit and the iliac vein that will be our lateral limit. Once the umbilical artery is located, the peritoneum between the vein and the artery is cut as mentioned and we access to the obturator fossa. We move forward in our dissection downwards and towards. Here we meet up again with the umbilical artery that as we are saying it's our medial limit. We keep moving forward and the next structure that we are going to find is the obturator nerve that is going to serve as well as lateral limit. Right below the obturator nerve, the obturator vein appears. This vein is surrounded by the fat tissue that we should medially reject in order to make progress in our dissection. It's convenient to create an adequate field of vision because as you can see this area is fully occupied by relevant vascular structures with a high risk of bleeding. That way having an adequate field will make easier in case we have any incident during the surgery. We keep moving forward and here we are getting rid of more adipose tissue and we come up with a muscular structure named myotendinous arc. This structure is important because right below it we locate the sciatic spine that is a key anatomic point in this surgery because the sacral spinal ligament is inserted in it. In this moment we are cutting the coccygeus muscle that is a thin and wide muscular structure that covers the sacral spinal ligament. It's convenient to use some sort of energy system. In this case we are using bipolar energy because this is a structure that bleeds with relative ease. Once we finish cutting the coccygeus muscle the sacral spinal ligament is exposed. This is a strong fairly wide structure that we will cut as close as possible to the sciatic spine. When we start cutting the sacral spinal ligament the pudendal neurovascular complex structures appears. Here we can see both the pudendal vein and artery. We keep cutting the ligament until reach a fatty tissue that will indicate the end of our section and the beginning of the alkyl scanal. Here we can see the fat tissue. Right in this moment the pudendal nerve is left uncovered and completely released. Once the nerve is released we just have to check the mustaches and we conclude our procedure by routinely instilling a mixture of corticoid and local anesthetic. We don't put any drainage and of course we close the peritoneal defect. The follow-up of the office was at one, three and six months and the visual anologic scale was two, nine preoperative.

The case is a 54 year old female. The background was two vaginal deliveries, two episodes of trauma over the coxis and repetition cystitis. For the last four years, she complains about dyspareunia and pain in the left vaginal and perianal region. The pain is worse with defecation and urination. The pain is very intense, 9 in the visual analogical scale and gets worse throughout the day and when sitting up. It's a pain in bed and allowing to sleep normally. Clinical findings, sensibility, research, intense pain when pressing the left ischial spine, pelvic MNR without pathological findings. See the guided pudendal block, positive diagnostic response. Based on Nantes criteria, the patient was diagnosed of left pudendal neuralgia and trait in the pain unit by neuromodulator drugs and radiofrequency following our protocol. The outcome was unsatisfactory, so the surgery was decided. The surgeon is placed in the side opposite to the nerve to be released. We usually use four truckers, three of five and one of ten millimeters. We are located in the left side of the pelvis and our first objective is locating both, the umbilical artery that is going to be our medial limit and the iliac vein that will be our lateral limit. Once the umbilical artery is located, the peritoneum between the vein and the artery is cut as mentioned and we access to the obturator fossa. We move forward in our dissection downwards and towards. Here we meet up again with the umbilical artery that as we are saying it's our medial limit. We keep moving forward and the next structure that we are going to find is the obturator nerve that is going to serve as well as lateral limit. Right below the obturator nerve, the obturator vein appears. This vein is surrounded by the fat tissue that we should medially reject in order to make progress in our dissection. It's convenient to create an adequate field of vision because as you can see this area is fully occupied by relevant vascular structures with a high risk of bleeding. That way having an adequate field will make easier in case we have any incident during the surgery. We keep moving forward and here we are getting rid of more adipose tissue and we come up with a muscular structure named myotendinous arc. This structure is important because right below it we locate the sciatic spine that is a key anatomic point in this surgery because the sacral spinal ligament is inserted in it. In this moment we are cutting the coccygeus muscle that is a thin and wide muscular structure that covers the sacral spinal ligament. It's convenient to use some sort of energy system. In this case we are using bipolar energy because this is a structure that bleeds with relative ease. Once we finish cutting the coccygeus muscle the sacral spinal ligament is exposed. This is a strong fairly wide structure that we will cut as close as possible to the sciatic spine. When we start cutting the sacral spinal ligament the pudendal neurovascular complex structures appears. Here we can see both the pudendal vein and artery. We keep cutting the ligament until reach a fatty tissue that will indicate the end of our section and the beginning of the alkyl scanal. Here we can see the fat tissue. Right in this moment the pudendal nerve is left uncovered and completely released. Once the nerve is released we just have to check the mustaches and we conclude our procedure by routinely instilling a mixture of corticoid and local anesthetic.

And those can be used interchangeably, and sometimes they cannot. We're gonna specifically call out one case in this series that was in fact a pudendal nerve pain and we know that for sure. So we are going to look at these three cases, starting with the youngest gentlemen...all these will be males. Pelvic floor pain, I don't remember what specific side, but it also included some genitourinary symptoms...such as problems with an erection. I'm gonna go ahead and draw in some of the changes so you can see the shift that's here in the body. This is the lower pelvic area, this is splitting the middle of the pelvis and you can see how on the image on the left the upper body masss leans over towards the right. We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues. The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up. Okay so that was the final installment of \"10 patients in 10 minutes.\" Dr. Zachary ward here at Life In Alignment Chiropractic, If you've any questions about anything in this video, or any of the other videos (clearly we've gone over one minute for this video) but you can look up more at LIAChiro.com.

Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up.

And those can be used interchangeably, and sometimes they cannot. We're gonna specifically call out one case in this series that was in fact a pudendal nerve pain and we know that for sure. So we are going to look at these three cases, starting with the youngest gentlemen...all these will be males. Pelvic floor pain, I don't remember what specific side, but it also included some genitourinary symptoms...such as problems with an erection. I'm gonna go ahead and draw in some of the changes so you can see the shift that's here in the body. This is the lower pelvic area, this is splitting the middle of the pelvis and you can see how on the image on the left the upper body masss leans over towards the right. We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues.

This is the lower pelvic area, this is splitting the middle of the pelvis and you can see how on the image on the left the upper body masss leans over towards the right. We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues. The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up.

Okay so that was the final installment of \"10 patients in 10 minutes.\" Dr. Zachary ward here at Life In Alignment Chiropractic, If you've any questions about anything in this video, or any of the other videos (clearly we've gone over one minute for this video) but you can look up more at LIAChiro.com. You can call my office line: 248-598-4002. Also on Facebook at /LIAChiropractic. I hope you found this informative, especially if you do deal with pelvic floor pain.

So I'm grateful and thankful for anyone out there that needs to have something done that Dr. Agala can help them with. She definitely needs to do it.

Watching games, you know, riding a bike, riding a horse, doing anything. She came to us feeling very hopeless and feeling like she was at the end of her rope. There's a small yellow structure right down in there and that's called the pudendal nerve. It runs right under this ligament and then turns the corner and ends up running right in here. Okay? And that was the source for pain. And I'm sitting here and I'm not in pain from sitting here, which is nothing short of a miracle to me. So I'm grateful and thankful for anyone out there that needs to have something done that Dr. Agala can help them with. She definitely needs to do it.

Thankfully, this will help us figure out exactly what to do. The pudendal nerve is a nerve that I operate on. I do it fairly routinely. More than anything, while we're excited to be able to make a diagnosis, what I'm most excited about is being able to offer Darcy something she hasn't had in a really long time. And that's hope.

I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day. I'm Dr. Alan Mandel."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day.

So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day.

I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement.

They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day. I'm Dr. Alan Mandel."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to.

Many patients that I've treated in the past have found limited benefit or relief from surgery or from traditional therapy such as injections of steroids. Pudendal neuralgia is caused by many different things, but commonly we see chronic inflammation and impairment in the nerve function. Stem cell therapy is unique in that it not only provides the ability for the body to restore or to block the inflammatory response, but it can actually permanently restore normal blood vessels, providing oxygen to that nerve, which is essential for the repair process. Even in situations where the nerve becomes entrapped by tissue, it's typically an inflammatory response, and the stem cells are incredible at breaking down that inflammatory tissue and helping to restore normal function. Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that affects at least 1% of the population, women more so than men, but it's not something that we need to suffer from. As we begin to understand better how to utilize stem cells and with the background and knowledge and expertise that we have here in pelvic and reconstructive surgery, it really helps us to understand how best to apply these new treatments for your specific condition."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Rachel fellers can now enjoy the ancient practice of yoga because a centuries-old treatment is allowing her to do it pain-free. I feel amazing. Rachel is at Loyola University Medical Center for an advanced type of acupuncture. After years of chronic pain in her abdomen, this is now allowing her to live a more normal life. It all started when she was 12 with terrible dehydration and vomiting. I also passed out in the middle church and had to be carried out. She tried everything, even traditional acupuncture, but nothing worked. But this acupuncture study involves placing the needles in a more concentrated way and includes heating the needles to target the most painful areas. If I put the needles in and the heat penetrates all the way into your booboo, how good would that feel? Rachel was blown away by the results.

But a Chicago Medical Center thinks a new form of acupuncture could very well be the hope that many women are looking for, a way to end chronic pelvic pain. Rachel fellers can now enjoy the ancient practice of yoga because a centuries-old treatment is allowing her to do it pain-free. I feel amazing. Rachel is at Loyola University Medical Center for an advanced type of acupuncture. After years of chronic pain in her abdomen, this is now allowing her to live a more normal life. It all started when she was 12 with terrible dehydration and vomiting. I also passed out in the middle church and had to be carried out. She tried everything, even traditional acupuncture, but nothing worked. But this acupuncture study involves placing the needles in a more concentrated way and includes heating the needles to target the most painful areas. If I put the needles in and the heat penetrates all the way into your booboo, how good would that feel? Rachel was blown away by the results. Thankfulness and gratitude that I wasn't trapped inside of my body anymore. Rachel's doctor says every patient in the study who's been getting the treatment and not the placebo has been coming back for follow-ups. Without me ever telling them what arm of the treatment you are getting, that's got to tell you something. For Rachel, the results include a night and day better relationship with her husband and her kids. Rachel's doctor says the only side effect is some occasional bruising. The results of the clinical trial will be published next year. Rachel wants people to know that this is symptom management, not a cure, but with ongoing treatment their quality of life can and will improve."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}
