Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb it's a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteries. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. At this time I'm cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient has had a very long standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thin fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of the surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery.

At this time I'm cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient has had a very long standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley.

I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of the surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

The A1 pulley is a very thin fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of the surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

This next video is going to be a trigger finger release. We're going to be releasing the A1 pulley of this patient's finger, which is what causes the trigger. The surgery, as usual, starts with the marking of my incision with a skin marker. Here you'll see I'm palpating the A1 pulley. You can feel this in your own hand as the pea-sized knot right in this location. People who have trigger fingers, this is often enlarged and extremely tender. You actually have several options in this particular incision. You can do a diagonal incision, you can do a straight on incision, and some people do one that is transversely across the palm. Testing the anesthesia with some forceps, making sure that the patient is comfortable, and the skin incision is made with a 15 blade scalpel. As in with most of the other surgeries that you'll be watching, there are always important structures immediately below the skin, especially in the hand. You have to be very careful when making a decision not to plunge deep down into those structures, and therefore we proceed nice and slow, dissecting down and identifying nerves and arteries that need to be preserved. The dissection is taken down through to the A1 pulley, and as I encounter any small blood vessels, those are cauterized with bipolar cauterine. Using scissors to gently spread down to the A1 pulley, I'm being careful to protect the digital nerves and arteries. This is a trigger finger retractor, which you see just go in. Now I'm getting a few final bands of fibrous tissue off of the A1 pulley, so that I can see the pulley clearly and divide it. The camera is showing an excellent view of the A1 pulley. It's the white structure that I'm pointing at now with my freer elevator. You can also see, if you look closely, the white line between the pulley and the tendon, which is slightly more yellow. Right there is the end of the pulley. The pulley is then divided longitudinally. Here I'm using a beaver blade to start the cut, and then I will come back in with some littler scissors and finish that. You're now seeing the flexor tendon, which is nicely displayed after the A1 pulley is retracted off of it. I'm then using some scissors to just gently push away the leaflets of the A1 pulley. Now I'm picking up the pulley with my forceps to demonstrate the anatomy. The digital nerves and arteries are just on the outside of this. I also use a retractor to pick up both flexor tendons to the finger and make sure that there's no fibrous connection between them. There's often quite a bit of scarring between both tendons and somebody who has a severe A1 pulley disease, and I like to break up those adhesions prior to finishing the surgery. This patient's finger is nice and smooth and the triggering is gone. Oftentimes the patient will be awake during this and just under local anesthetic. In those situations we can actually ask the patient to move their finger and demonstrate that the triggering is now gone. The wound was gently irrigated with saline and now we're going to be closing this with some nylon sutures. I'm going to be using a horizontal mattress technique. These sutures are usually left in for eight days. We allow the patient to take down their dressing at day four and cover these with a band-aid. The patient in the recovery room starts doing some exercises immediately, keeping the finger moving, and is asked to make fists at least 10 times an hour until follow-up. Some zero form dressing is then applied over the wound and that's the end of this trigger finger release. Hope you enjoyed it. Thanks for watching."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

There's often quite a bit of scarring between both tendons and somebody who has a severe A1 pulley disease, and I like to break up those adhesions prior to finishing the surgery. This patient's finger is nice and smooth and the triggering is gone. Oftentimes the patient will be awake during this and just under local anesthetic. In those situations we can actually ask the patient to move their finger and demonstrate that the triggering is now gone. The wound was gently irrigated with saline and now we're going to be closing this with some nylon sutures. I'm going to be using a horizontal mattress technique. These sutures are usually left in for eight days. We allow the patient to take down their dressing at day four and cover these with a band-aid. The patient in the recovery room starts doing some exercises immediately, keeping the finger moving, and is asked to make fists at least 10 times an hour until follow-up. Some zero form dressing is then applied over the wound and that's the end of this trigger finger release. Hope you enjoyed it. Thanks for watching."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

This was soon adapted to initial procedures. The main advantage of this procedure is that it can be done in an office setting effectively with minimal morbidity. After the first presentation at a national meeting, there was a general reluctance to perform the procedure. This continues until the present time and appears to be due to a safety concern about damage to the tendons and nerves. The procedure has evolved over the past 35 years. This short video will demonstrate the procedure with emphasis on safety and effectiveness. The actual triggering must be identified at the time of the procedure because the completeness of the release is determined by the absence of triggering. If there is a history of triggering and only recurrent pain, intrathecal steroid injection is the preferred management. If on physical examination there is some more than usual thickening of the A1 pulley, then ultrasound is now recommended to demonstrate hypertrophic tenosynovium, which is one of our remaining few indications for an open release when an intrathecal injection is not successful. The patient is instructed to surgically scrub his hand using a scrub brush followed by sterile water irrigation. The hand is then wrapped in a sterile towel while the patient is walked to a seat where the procedure will be performed. I prefer to have some patients lie down, especially if they are anxious. The surgeon should be the individual to inject the local anesthetic because the tendon sheath can be palpated and precisely identified at the time. The most easily tolerated injection in my experience begins at the MP flexion crease extending gently proximally, injecting in and along the tendon sheath and also superficially enough so that subsequent needle sticks are minimally felt by the patient. Palpation of the patient's palm with the thumb of the non-dominant hand just to the side of the flexor sheath makes it easier for the surgeon to direct the needle along the course of the A1 pulley and get superficial enough without worrying about puncturing the skin and even sustaining a needle stick injury himself. A 30 gauge needle is used to inject 1% lidocaine using a 10 milliliter syringe. The injection is done to a point approximately 1 cm proximal to the proximal transverse polymer crease. I begin the release proximally to the proximal flexion crease using a 16 gauge needle which is large enough to feel under the skin and stiff enough so that it can be easily controlled without bending. The dominant hand is used to pierce the skin and direct the course of the needle longitudinally over the flexor tendon sheath. The actual release is done from proximally to distally with a downward pressure with a non-dominant thumb to release the horizontal bands of the A1 pulley one at a time with only the needle tip, similar to a subcutaneous release of a dupetron's band using the Luck Fasciotomy technique. The vertical orientation of the needle tip is also maintained by identifying the position of the syringe with a needle in the vertical position before insertion. This technique I have dubbed the Pressure Push Method. Specifically placing the needle point underneath the flexor tendon sheath is avoided to avoid cutting the flexor tendon. Also having the patient totally relax the finger is critical because it further reduces the chance of the tendon to be damaged because only the tight tendon sheath is under tension, not the flexor tendon. After the first pass, the needle is gently used to palpate the released A1 pulley, releasing any remaining bands. Then the needle is retracted completely and the patient asks to flex and extend the finger. The site of any remaining triggering at that time can be determined with palpation and a new insertion point along the course of the A1 pulley more distally can be used to further precisely divide any remaining contributing bands. Usually a third puncture site is required to completely release the A1 pulley. Again, after each pass, during retraction of the needle, gentle palpation is used to determine whether any remaining bands need to be popped. Incomplete release is the end point of the procedure because an incomplete release appears never to get better with time. A folded 4x4 gauze is held in place with a half length 2 inch ace wrap. The patient is instructed to move his fingers normally and elevate his hand for at least 24 hours. An analgesic such as Tylenol 3 is prescribed. The following morning the patient is instructed to remove the dressing, wash his hands normally and reapply the ace wrap which can be helpful for the next two or three days. The average course is one or two days of discomfort. I have had patients resume playing golf the following day. Most patients however have some discomfort for about a week. A few patients have pain longer than that and I have had a handful that have had a reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome which required hand therapy. In general most patients do better than those with an open procedure."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Also having the patient totally relax the finger is critical because it further reduces the chance of the tendon to be damaged because only the tight tendon sheath is under tension, not the flexor tendon. After the first pass, the needle is gently used to palpate the released A1 pulley, releasing any remaining bands. Then the needle is retracted completely and the patient asks to flex and extend the finger. The site of any remaining triggering at that time can be determined with palpation and a new insertion point along the course of the A1 pulley more distally can be used to further precisely divide any remaining contributing bands. Usually a third puncture site is required to completely release the A1 pulley. Again, after each pass, during retraction of the needle, gentle palpation is used to determine whether any remaining bands need to be popped. Incomplete release is the end point of the procedure because an incomplete release appears never to get better with time. A folded 4x4 gauze is held in place with a half length 2 inch ace wrap. The patient is instructed to move his fingers normally and elevate his hand for at least 24 hours. An analgesic such as Tylenol 3 is prescribed. The following morning the patient is instructed to remove the dressing, wash his hands normally and reapply the ace wrap which can be helpful for the next two or three days. The average course is one or two days of discomfort. I have had patients resume playing golf the following day. Most patients however have some discomfort for about a week. A few patients have pain longer than that and I have had a handful that have had a reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome which required hand therapy.

This was soon adapted to initial procedures. The main advantage of this procedure is that it can be done in an office setting effectively with minimal morbidity. After the first presentation at a national meeting, there was a general reluctance to perform the procedure. This continues until the present time and appears to be due to a safety concern about damage to the tendons and nerves. The procedure has evolved over the past 35 years. This short video will demonstrate the procedure with emphasis on safety and effectiveness. The actual triggering must be identified at the time of the procedure because the completeness of the release is determined by the absence of triggering. If there is a history of triggering and only recurrent pain, intrathecal steroid injection is the preferred management. If on physical examination there is some more than usual thickening of the A1 pulley, then ultrasound is now recommended to demonstrate hypertrophic tenosynovium, which is one of our remaining few indications for an open release when an intrathecal injection is not successful. The patient is instructed to surgically scrub his hand using a scrub brush followed by sterile water irrigation. The hand is then wrapped in a sterile towel while the patient is walked to a seat where the procedure will be performed. I prefer to have some patients lie down, especially if they are anxious. The surgeon should be the individual to inject the local anesthetic because the tendon sheath can be palpated and precisely identified at the time. The most easily tolerated injection in my experience begins at the MP flexion crease extending gently proximally, injecting in and along the tendon sheath and also superficially enough so that subsequent needle sticks are minimally felt by the patient. Palpation of the patient's palm with the thumb of the non-dominant hand just to the side of the flexor sheath makes it easier for the surgeon to direct the needle along the course of the A1 pulley and get superficial enough without worrying about puncturing the skin and even sustaining a needle stick injury himself. A 30 gauge needle is used to inject 1% lidocaine using a 10 milliliter syringe. The injection is done to a point approximately 1 cm proximal to the proximal transverse polymer crease. I begin the release proximally to the proximal flexion crease using a 16 gauge needle which is large enough to feel under the skin and stiff enough so that it can be easily controlled without bending. The dominant hand is used to pierce the skin and direct the course of the needle longitudinally over the flexor tendon sheath. The actual release is done from proximally to distally with a downward pressure with a non-dominant thumb to release the horizontal bands of the A1 pulley one at a time with only the needle tip, similar to a subcutaneous release of a dupetron's band using the Luck Fasciotomy technique.

The actual triggering must be identified at the time of the procedure because the completeness of the release is determined by the absence of triggering. If there is a history of triggering and only recurrent pain, intrathecal steroid injection is the preferred management. If on physical examination there is some more than usual thickening of the A1 pulley, then ultrasound is now recommended to demonstrate hypertrophic tenosynovium, which is one of our remaining few indications for an open release when an intrathecal injection is not successful. The patient is instructed to surgically scrub his hand using a scrub brush followed by sterile water irrigation. The hand is then wrapped in a sterile towel while the patient is walked to a seat where the procedure will be performed. I prefer to have some patients lie down, especially if they are anxious. The surgeon should be the individual to inject the local anesthetic because the tendon sheath can be palpated and precisely identified at the time. The most easily tolerated injection in my experience begins at the MP flexion crease extending gently proximally, injecting in and along the tendon sheath and also superficially enough so that subsequent needle sticks are minimally felt by the patient. Palpation of the patient's palm with the thumb of the non-dominant hand just to the side of the flexor sheath makes it easier for the surgeon to direct the needle along the course of the A1 pulley and get superficial enough without worrying about puncturing the skin and even sustaining a needle stick injury himself. A 30 gauge needle is used to inject 1% lidocaine using a 10 milliliter syringe. The injection is done to a point approximately 1 cm proximal to the proximal transverse polymer crease. I begin the release proximally to the proximal flexion crease using a 16 gauge needle which is large enough to feel under the skin and stiff enough so that it can be easily controlled without bending. The dominant hand is used to pierce the skin and direct the course of the needle longitudinally over the flexor tendon sheath. The actual release is done from proximally to distally with a downward pressure with a non-dominant thumb to release the horizontal bands of the A1 pulley one at a time with only the needle tip, similar to a subcutaneous release of a dupetron's band using the Luck Fasciotomy technique. The vertical orientation of the needle tip is also maintained by identifying the position of the syringe with a needle in the vertical position before insertion. This technique I have dubbed the Pressure Push Method. Specifically placing the needle point underneath the flexor tendon sheath is avoided to avoid cutting the flexor tendon. Also having the patient totally relax the finger is critical because it further reduces the chance of the tendon to be damaged because only the tight tendon sheath is under tension, not the flexor tendon. After the first pass, the needle is gently used to palpate the released A1 pulley, releasing any remaining bands. Then the needle is retracted completely and the patient asks to flex and extend the finger. The site of any remaining triggering at that time can be determined with palpation and a new insertion point along the course of the A1 pulley more distally can be used to further precisely divide any remaining contributing bands. Usually a third puncture site is required to completely release the A1 pulley. Again, after each pass, during retraction of the needle, gentle palpation is used to determine whether any remaining bands need to be popped. Incomplete release is the end point of the procedure because an incomplete release appears never to get better with time. A folded 4x4 gauze is held in place with a half length 2 inch ace wrap. The patient is instructed to move his fingers normally and elevate his hand for at least 24 hours. An analgesic such as Tylenol 3 is prescribed. The following morning the patient is instructed to remove the dressing, wash his hands normally and reapply the ace wrap which can be helpful for the next two or three days. The average course is one or two days of discomfort. I have had patients resume playing golf the following day. Most patients however have some discomfort for about a week. A few patients have pain longer than that and I have had a handful that have had a reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome which required hand therapy. In general most patients do better than those with an open procedure."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little red structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. Once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and that it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric caudary. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which everts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. It usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain.

First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little red structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. Once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and that it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric caudary. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which everts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. It usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain.

Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little red structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. Once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and that it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric caudary. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which everts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. It usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand, and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

So far more than a thousand patients have been treated using the new technique."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

So it comes in different sizes. I have two sizes here with me. They say the size on the back. This one is a four and then this one is a seven. So they come they go all the way up to like 14. So I'll put a link and then you'll want to make sure that you measure yourself so you know which size is right for you. The way that this helps with trigger finger is so say my middle finger is popping or clicking. So this video isn't really about trigger finger or the signs and symptoms of it. But if you know you have trigger finger or you know that your finger is catching or locking, meaning like when you make a fist, it has you have a hard time lifting it back up. That's an indicator that you could possibly have a trigger finger. You want to get a doctor to make that diagnosis for you. But if your finger is really clicking or popping whenever you're making a fist or it's getting stuck, that is a good sign that you could have a trigger finger. And that's an inflammation of your flexor tendon and your tendon goes through pulleys. So there's a bunch of pulleys on your fingers that help hold the tendon down against the bone. If you didn't have those, our tendons would be popping away from the bone. So sometimes, though, that swelling gets enlarged. So the fluid around that tendon becomes bigger. And it's like pulling a grape through a straw, which is usually right down there because that's where people have the most pain. And when you go to grasp, it's like pulling that thickened area through something that's like this size meant for something that's like this size. And that's why you get that popping or that clicking or that catching. And then it can stay down. And then it's unable to get back through that pulley, and that's when you have to physically pull that up. So say my ring finger is getting stuck down. So you put the oval eight splint on your finger and you put it so that the round part is fitting over your joint. And what happens is it keeps you from making a full fist. So it still lets you bend here at the tip, which is important. And it still lets you bend at the knuckle, which is also important. But it won't let you make the full fist, which is what causes the trigger finger is when you bend at all three joints, some trigger finger products or splints will go all the way down through the knuckle and actually block you from bending at the knuckle, and they let you bend here and here. I don't have one of those with me today, but those are usually fine, too. But if you can keep this one or the one here from bending when you make a fist, you should be able to eliminate that catching and popping. The goal is to make sure you avoid the catching or the popping. Some people think that if they grip a ball, they can kind of grip the trigger finger right out of there. But that's not the case. And in fact, that can make it worse. So you want to avoid the clicking and popping, and this ring can really help that. So it still will let you use your hand for light activities because you still should be able to hold an onion if you've got a cut. You should still be able to do some laundry. You should still be able to blow dry your hair. It's not going to affect your function as much as a really big splint would. Now, I will make note that this joint then is going to get a little stiff if you have it on all the time. Now, you can take it off at nighttime as long as you notice when you're sleeping that you're not clenching your fist when you're sleeping. Because then when you wake up, you may notice, oh, no, it's back to where it was. When you take the splint off, if the joint feels very stiff, what you can do is just do some gentle movements where you just are taking your other hand to gently bend that joint so it doesn't get very stiff. So notice I'm just gently moving the joint with this hand. I don't want to come all the way down and potentially have that start triggering or popping again and get more inflammation to that area. If you want to try the oval eight splint to help block that full motion to help get rid of trigger finger, I think this could help you. Four to six weeks is going to be about the amount of time that you'll need to get the inflammation out of that tendon and let that tendon rest before you start noticing a difference in your finger. And hopefully that trigger finger has gone away. I would slowly wean yourself out of that, basically meaning take it off every once in a while for light activities.

And hopefully that trigger finger has gone away. I would slowly wean yourself out of that, basically meaning take it off every once in a while for light activities. If you need more assistance or you're looking for more information on how to get rid of trigger finger or perhaps what you should do after a trigger finger surgery, follow the link below. We can show you exactly what you need to do online for preventing trigger finger, for how to stop trigger finger or what to do if you tried everything and you still had to have trigger finger release, we can help you.

So it comes in different sizes. I have two sizes here with me. They say the size on the back. This one is a four and then this one is a seven. So they come they go all the way up to like 14. So I'll put a link and then you'll want to make sure that you measure yourself so you know which size is right for you. The way that this helps with trigger finger is so say my middle finger is popping or clicking. So this video isn't really about trigger finger or the signs and symptoms of it. But if you know you have trigger finger or you know that your finger is catching or locking, meaning like when you make a fist, it has you have a hard time lifting it back up. That's an indicator that you could possibly have a trigger finger. You want to get a doctor to make that diagnosis for you. But if your finger is really clicking or popping whenever you're making a fist or it's getting stuck, that is a good sign that you could have a trigger finger. And that's an inflammation of your flexor tendon and your tendon goes through pulleys. So there's a bunch of pulleys on your fingers that help hold the tendon down against the bone. If you didn't have those, our tendons would be popping away from the bone. So sometimes, though, that swelling gets enlarged. So the fluid around that tendon becomes bigger. And it's like pulling a grape through a straw, which is usually right down there because that's where people have the most pain. And when you go to grasp, it's like pulling that thickened area through something that's like this size meant for something that's like this size. And that's why you get that popping or that clicking or that catching. And then it can stay down. And then it's unable to get back through that pulley, and that's when you have to physically pull that up. So say my ring finger is getting stuck down. So you put the oval eight splint on your finger and you put it so that the round part is fitting over your joint. And what happens is it keeps you from making a full fist. So it still lets you bend here at the tip, which is important. And it still lets you bend at the knuckle, which is also important. But it won't let you make the full fist, which is what causes the trigger finger is when you bend at all three joints, some trigger finger products or splints will go all the way down through the knuckle and actually block you from bending at the knuckle, and they let you bend here and here. I don't have one of those with me today, but those are usually fine, too. But if you can keep this one or the one here from bending when you make a fist, you should be able to eliminate that catching and popping. The goal is to make sure you avoid the catching or the popping. Some people think that if they grip a ball, they can kind of grip the trigger finger right out of there. But that's not the case. And in fact, that can make it worse. So you want to avoid the clicking and popping, and this ring can really help that. So it still will let you use your hand for light activities because you still should be able to hold an onion if you've got a cut. You should still be able to do some laundry. You should still be able to blow dry your hair. It's not going to affect your function as much as a really big splint would. Now, I will make note that this joint then is going to get a little stiff if you have it on all the time. Now, you can take it off at nighttime as long as you notice when you're sleeping that you're not clenching your fist when you're sleeping. Because then when you wake up, you may notice, oh, no, it's back to where it was. When you take the splint off, if the joint feels very stiff, what you can do is just do some gentle movements where you just are taking your other hand to gently bend that joint so it doesn't get very stiff. So notice I'm just gently moving the joint with this hand. I don't want to come all the way down and potentially have that start triggering or popping again and get more inflammation to that area.

When you take the splint off, if the joint feels very stiff, what you can do is just do some gentle movements where you just are taking your other hand to gently bend that joint so it doesn't get very stiff. So notice I'm just gently moving the joint with this hand. I don't want to come all the way down and potentially have that start triggering or popping again and get more inflammation to that area. If you want to try the oval eight splint to help block that full motion to help get rid of trigger finger, I think this could help you. Four to six weeks is going to be about the amount of time that you'll need to get the inflammation out of that tendon and let that tendon rest before you start noticing a difference in your finger. And hopefully that trigger finger has gone away. I would slowly wean yourself out of that, basically meaning take it off every once in a while for light activities. If you need more assistance or you're looking for more information on how to get rid of trigger finger or perhaps what you should do after a trigger finger surgery, follow the link below. We can show you exactly what you need to do online for preventing trigger finger, for how to stop trigger finger or what to do if you tried everything and you still had to have trigger finger release, we can help you.

So it comes in different sizes. I have two sizes here with me. They say the size on the back. This one is a four and then this one is a seven. So they come they go all the way up to like 14. So I'll put a link and then you'll want to make sure that you measure yourself so you know which size is right for you. The way that this helps with trigger finger is so say my middle finger is popping or clicking. So this video isn't really about trigger finger or the signs and symptoms of it. But if you know you have trigger finger or you know that your finger is catching or locking, meaning like when you make a fist, it has you have a hard time lifting it back up. That's an indicator that you could possibly have a trigger finger. You want to get a doctor to make that diagnosis for you. But if your finger is really clicking or popping whenever you're making a fist or it's getting stuck, that is a good sign that you could have a trigger finger. And that's an inflammation of your flexor tendon and your tendon goes through pulleys. So there's a bunch of pulleys on your fingers that help hold the tendon down against the bone. If you didn't have those, our tendons would be popping away from the bone. So sometimes, though, that swelling gets enlarged. So the fluid around that tendon becomes bigger. And it's like pulling a grape through a straw, which is usually right down there because that's where people have the most pain. And when you go to grasp, it's like pulling that thickened area through something that's like this size meant for something that's like this size. And that's why you get that popping or that clicking or that catching. And then it can stay down. And then it's unable to get back through that pulley, and that's when you have to physically pull that up. So say my ring finger is getting stuck down. So you put the oval eight splint on your finger and you put it so that the round part is fitting over your joint. And what happens is it keeps you from making a full fist. So it still lets you bend here at the tip, which is important. And it still lets you bend at the knuckle, which is also important. But it won't let you make the full fist, which is what causes the trigger finger is when you bend at all three joints, some trigger finger products or splints will go all the way down through the knuckle and actually block you from bending at the knuckle, and they let you bend here and here. I don't have one of those with me today, but those are usually fine, too. But if you can keep this one or the one here from bending when you make a fist, you should be able to eliminate that catching and popping. The goal is to make sure you avoid the catching or the popping. Some people think that if they grip a ball, they can kind of grip the trigger finger right out of there. But that's not the case. And in fact, that can make it worse. So you want to avoid the clicking and popping, and this ring can really help that. So it still will let you use your hand for light activities because you still should be able to hold an onion if you've got a cut. You should still be able to do some laundry. You should still be able to blow dry your hair. It's not going to affect your function as much as a really big splint would. Now, I will make note that this joint then is going to get a little stiff if you have it on all the time. Now, you can take it off at nighttime as long as you notice when you're sleeping that you're not clenching your fist when you're sleeping.

My name is Dr. Storey. I'm going to give you realistic advice based on my experience and the scientific literature. Now trigger finger is a situation where you start to develop adhesions inside the tendon. So the tendon has a sheath that will slide and if adhesions and scar tissue build up around that tendon you're going to get lots of problems. The finger will start to pull down. You won't be able to stretch it. Some people will get like a snapping finger. It can happen in any finger but most commonly it's of the ring finger. Now there are three steps to getting rid of this problem and if it doesn't help then you have to go another route which I'll tell you at the end of the video. Number one you're going to do Graston technique. You need to find a practitioner who knows what they're doing. It's usually a chiropractor in your area and by the use of special Graston tools they're able to essentially break down the scar tissue in and around that tendon sheath and if you're able to remove the scar tissue which is essentially the cause of the problem then you're going to have a lot better results with the other procedures I'm going to talk about. The second thing that you can do to help with trigger finger is using heat and stretching. By applying a heating pad to your hand for about 10 minutes and then stretching the actual tendon you can have really good results in allowing that scar tissue to not develop and actually slide. So the way you would stretch the trigger finger is I would go behind the hand grab the actual finger and start bending it just as I'm doing right here. Then you start to dorsiflex or extend your wrist and then what you can do is fully extend your elbow and holding that position for about two minutes is what's required to get the most amount of benefit from the stretching. Now should you stretch for 30 seconds? This is a common question. The answer is no. Two minutes is the amount that's required in order for your brain to understand the stretch reflex and allow the tissue to actually mold and change. Number three wear a splint at night. Very often patients will have problems with their trigger finger at nighttime because they're not moving it around. So if you can get a splint to help you so that it won't it won't get to be a problem at nighttime you'll sleep a lot better. I'm going to put a link down below. I'm an Amazon affiliate so I do get a small commission for it but we can have this special brace and splint sent to your door so you can start using it right away. Now sometimes these procedures that I just mentioned do not work and the reason why is if you wait too long for this problem to develop sometimes you're just quite frankly too late to the party. If there's too much scar tissue, if it's been around for too long, these self-help procedures may not actually work. If that's the case then you only have one other option and that option is you're going to have to go to a hand surgeon. Very likely they will try a series of cortisone shots into the actual tendon to reduce any inflammation and very often that irritation of just putting the needle in can actually stimulate the healing of that. The problem is that has a very poor success rate for the most part. The last procedure that they can use is surgery to actually release that tendon and I have had many patients that have had ended up having that surgery and sure enough a year and a half, two years later the problem comes right back. So it's not the greatest solution. You want to get to this problem earlier. The sooner you can treat it with Graston, the sooner you can treat it with stretching and the sooner you can get that brace and splint on your finger, the better off you're going to be.

My name is Dr. Storey. I'm going to give you realistic advice based on my experience and the scientific literature. Now trigger finger is a situation where you start to develop adhesions inside the tendon. So the tendon has a sheath that will slide and if adhesions and scar tissue build up around that tendon you're going to get lots of problems. The finger will start to pull down. You won't be able to stretch it. Some people will get like a snapping finger. It can happen in any finger but most commonly it's of the ring finger. Now there are three steps to getting rid of this problem and if it doesn't help then you have to go another route which I'll tell you at the end of the video. Number one you're going to do Graston technique. You need to find a practitioner who knows what they're doing. It's usually a chiropractor in your area and by the use of special Graston tools they're able to essentially break down the scar tissue in and around that tendon sheath and if you're able to remove the scar tissue which is essentially the cause of the problem then you're going to have a lot better results with the other procedures I'm going to talk about. The second thing that you can do to help with trigger finger is using heat and stretching. By applying a heating pad to your hand for about 10 minutes and then stretching the actual tendon you can have really good results in allowing that scar tissue to not develop and actually slide. So the way you would stretch the trigger finger is I would go behind the hand grab the actual finger and start bending it just as I'm doing right here. Then you start to dorsiflex or extend your wrist and then what you can do is fully extend your elbow and holding that position for about two minutes is what's required to get the most amount of benefit from the stretching. Now should you stretch for 30 seconds? This is a common question. The answer is no. Two minutes is the amount that's required in order for your brain to understand the stretch reflex and allow the tissue to actually mold and change. Number three wear a splint at night. Very often patients will have problems with their trigger finger at nighttime because they're not moving it around. So if you can get a splint to help you so that it won't it won't get to be a problem at nighttime you'll sleep a lot better. I'm going to put a link down below. I'm an Amazon affiliate so I do get a small commission for it but we can have this special brace and splint sent to your door so you can start using it right away. Now sometimes these procedures that I just mentioned do not work and the reason why is if you wait too long for this problem to develop sometimes you're just quite frankly too late to the party. If there's too much scar tissue, if it's been around for too long, these self-help procedures may not actually work. If that's the case then you only have one other option and that option is you're going to have to go to a hand surgeon. Very likely they will try a series of cortisone shots into the actual tendon to reduce any inflammation and very often that irritation of just putting the needle in can actually stimulate the healing of that. The problem is that has a very poor success rate for the most part. The last procedure that they can use is surgery to actually release that tendon and I have had many patients that have had ended up having that surgery and sure enough a year and a half, two years later the problem comes right back. So it's not the greatest solution. You want to get to this problem earlier. The sooner you can treat it with Graston, the sooner you can treat it with stretching and the sooner you can get that brace and splint on your finger, the better off you're going to be. So if you have any questions regarding this and you'd like to talk to me personally about your situation, we are offering zoom appointments. So we can do a zoom appointment or we can do a telephone consultation. My information is down below where you can find my website and my contact information.

The last procedure that they can use is surgery to actually release that tendon and I have had many patients that have had ended up having that surgery and sure enough a year and a half, two years later the problem comes right back.

My name is Dr. Storey. I'm going to give you realistic advice based on my experience and the scientific literature. Now trigger finger is a situation where you start to develop adhesions inside the tendon. So the tendon has a sheath that will slide and if adhesions and scar tissue build up around that tendon you're going to get lots of problems. The finger will start to pull down. You won't be able to stretch it. Some people will get like a snapping finger. It can happen in any finger but most commonly it's of the ring finger. Now there are three steps to getting rid of this problem and if it doesn't help then you have to go another route which I'll tell you at the end of the video. Number one you're going to do Graston technique. You need to find a practitioner who knows what they're doing. It's usually a chiropractor in your area and by the use of special Graston tools they're able to essentially break down the scar tissue in and around that tendon sheath and if you're able to remove the scar tissue which is essentially the cause of the problem then you're going to have a lot better results with the other procedures I'm going to talk about. The second thing that you can do to help with trigger finger is using heat and stretching. By applying a heating pad to your hand for about 10 minutes and then stretching the actual tendon you can have really good results in allowing that scar tissue to not develop and actually slide. So the way you would stretch the trigger finger is I would go behind the hand grab the actual finger and start bending it just as I'm doing right here. Then you start to dorsiflex or extend your wrist and then what you can do is fully extend your elbow and holding that position for about two minutes is what's required to get the most amount of benefit from the stretching. Now should you stretch for 30 seconds? This is a common question. The answer is no. Two minutes is the amount that's required in order for your brain to understand the stretch reflex and allow the tissue to actually mold and change. Number three wear a splint at night. Very often patients will have problems with their trigger finger at nighttime because they're not moving it around. So if you can get a splint to help you so that it won't it won't get to be a problem at nighttime you'll sleep a lot better. I'm going to put a link down below. I'm an Amazon affiliate so I do get a small commission for it but we can have this special brace and splint sent to your door so you can start using it right away. Now sometimes these procedures that I just mentioned do not work and the reason why is if you wait too long for this problem to develop sometimes you're just quite frankly too late to the party. If there's too much scar tissue, if it's been around for too long, these self-help procedures may not actually work. If that's the case then you only have one other option and that option is you're going to have to go to a hand surgeon. Very likely they will try a series of cortisone shots into the actual tendon to reduce any inflammation and very often that irritation of just putting the needle in can actually stimulate the healing of that.

I had the surgery yesterday and it took about 35 minutes, probably 3 hours of getting prepared and being released and stuff like that. I convinced them to let me watch the surgery through the entire procedure and it's truly an amazing thing. This is, just so anyone knows, this is what the aftermath will look like for 6 days or so. And then I can remove this and have the stitches out and start doing hopefully some things with my fingers. This was the trigger finger and I can already actually bend it. I don't feel the catching of the trigger finger anymore. So who knows what will happen as it heals but as of this point it seems positive. I quickly described the surgery where I saw and let go of that I think for now. They cut a, probably a half inch hole in my hand and it's by a node where the tendons are going through this node to get to this finger here. So this decision is essentially right there. And then they use some forks to stretch out the skin wide enough so that they can pull out the tendons and operate on them. The tendons are incredible looking things like the most perfect rubber bands, pure white rubber bands. They have a very strong feeling. They pulled them out and stretched them so that they pretty much filled my palm with those two tendons going through the finger. So they had these two tendons out, stretched apart, perhaps two inches apart with what felt like a huge amount of tension on them. And there was obviously a lot of growth over the years that occurred on those tendons that was causing this problem. The tendons were cut off and scraped off and disposed of. And then this little myelin sheath, which is just like an eyelet on a fishing rod or something, at least metaphorically, was slit so that there would be more room I think in case there was more regrowth or something. I was able to test the finger while I was in the midst of this, when it was done actually. So I made a complete fist. It seemed like it was the first time I had been able to move the finger in a month I guess. Anyway, this morning is utterly miserable. You know, this astounding amount of pain in my fingers are just now really becoming unknown. You know, because there's a lot of local anesthetic involved in this thing. Even that wasn't really enough to keep the pain from being there, but it worked well enough. And I thought the surgeon was really good in terms of explaining things while he was doing them and allowing me to see this in the first place I guess. Usually this is a, whatever it's called, the Michael Jackson probe, propofol or something, type of operation where you're out cold. So that's the deal. I hope to be playing pretty soon. I don't think it's going to be one of these two-day things, but even this just gets in my way. But I think that when this comes off that it won't be long and that will be pretty much my PT is typing, playing, and the million other things that I do.

I had the surgery yesterday and it took about 35 minutes, probably 3 hours of getting prepared and being released and stuff like that. I convinced them to let me watch the surgery through the entire procedure and it's truly an amazing thing. This is, just so anyone knows, this is what the aftermath will look like for 6 days or so. And then I can remove this and have the stitches out and start doing hopefully some things with my fingers. This was the trigger finger and I can already actually bend it. I don't feel the catching of the trigger finger anymore. So who knows what will happen as it heals but as of this point it seems positive. I quickly described the surgery where I saw and let go of that I think for now. They cut a, probably a half inch hole in my hand and it's by a node where the tendons are going through this node to get to this finger here. So this decision is essentially right there. And then they use some forks to stretch out the skin wide enough so that they can pull out the tendons and operate on them. The tendons are incredible looking things like the most perfect rubber bands, pure white rubber bands. They have a very strong feeling. They pulled them out and stretched them so that they pretty much filled my palm with those two tendons going through the finger. So they had these two tendons out, stretched apart, perhaps two inches apart with what felt like a huge amount of tension on them. And there was obviously a lot of growth over the years that occurred on those tendons that was causing this problem. The tendons were cut off and scraped off and disposed of. And then this little myelin sheath, which is just like an eyelet on a fishing rod or something, at least metaphorically, was slit so that there would be more room I think in case there was more regrowth or something. I was able to test the finger while I was in the midst of this, when it was done actually. So I made a complete fist. It seemed like it was the first time I had been able to move the finger in a month I guess. Anyway, this morning is utterly miserable. You know, this astounding amount of pain in my fingers are just now really becoming unknown. You know, because there's a lot of local anesthetic involved in this thing. Even that wasn't really enough to keep the pain from being there, but it worked well enough. And I thought the surgeon was really good in terms of explaining things while he was doing them and allowing me to see this in the first place I guess. Usually this is a, whatever it's called, the Michael Jackson probe, propofol or something, type of operation where you're out cold. So that's the deal. I hope to be playing pretty soon.

The synovial tendon sheath and the tendon are clearly shown. Inflammation of the tendon sheath is known as stenosing tinosinovitis. Stenosing tinosinovitis of the thumb, often referred to as trigger thumb, is one of the more common abnormalities of the hand. This condition is associated with painful triggering or locking of the thumb. When the patient tries to straighten the thumb, the nodule jams beneath the pulley proximally. This occurs with a painful snap, much like a trigger being pulled and released, with either flexion or extension of the thumb. Small changes in the tendon's diameter will have a significant effect on the function of the thumb. The nodule is usually pulled proximally to the pulley with active thumb flexion. That includes anti-inflammatory medication and injection. Inject into the sheath, not the tendon. Put the needle obliquely towards the tendon. Withdraw the needle slightly and inject freely into the sheath. Ultrasound guided injection of the tendon sheath and pulley may be of benefit. The needle is inserted into the sheath above the tendon and fluid is injected. If symptoms persist, consider surgery. Release the pulley to allow active motion without triggering. Note the position of the radial digital nerve close to the incision. Everything seems to be fine with this thumb, but there's definitely something tricky going on with this one.

I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release, ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. Tell me what's going on with your fingers. So I just had this locking trigger finger for the last 6 months and it's where you have to pull it open manually now and there's no grip left. When you go to grab something it's just like\u2026 It's just stuck here, you see that? So it's stuck, he's not able to. So you have to, and this one too, but that's open, you see? It's not as bad but it still pops. It pops but here, are you trying to open it by yourself? Yeah he's trying. You can relax your hand. Let's bring it this way. Can you see that? Try to open this one. It's just stuck. You see the shakiness of his hand? Okay let's do the same thing here. Try to open it. Here you go, he's able to open it here but it's very slow but here it's just totally stuck. So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck? Yeah it's stuck completely. Now it's hanging up and it's not sticking. Nowhere near as bad as it used to. So before you manually have to do this. Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down? Yeah this is my predominant hand. Yeah I'm glad you're doing better. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Feel free to subscribe to my channel to get helpful tips on how to relieve pain.

Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down?

I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release, ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. Tell me what's going on with your fingers. So I just had this locking trigger finger for the last 6 months and it's where you have to pull it open manually now and there's no grip left. When you go to grab something it's just like\u2026 It's just stuck here, you see that? So it's stuck, he's not able to. So you have to, and this one too, but that's open, you see? It's not as bad but it still pops. It pops but here, are you trying to open it by yourself? Yeah he's trying. You can relax your hand. Let's bring it this way. Can you see that? Try to open this one. It's just stuck. You see the shakiness of his hand? Okay let's do the same thing here. Try to open it. Here you go, he's able to open it here but it's very slow but here it's just totally stuck. So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck?

I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release, ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. Tell me what's going on with your fingers. So I just had this locking trigger finger for the last 6 months and it's where you have to pull it open manually now and there's no grip left. When you go to grab something it's just like\u2026 It's just stuck here, you see that? So it's stuck, he's not able to. So you have to, and this one too, but that's open, you see? It's not as bad but it still pops. It pops but here, are you trying to open it by yourself? Yeah he's trying. You can relax your hand. Let's bring it this way. Can you see that? Try to open this one. It's just stuck. You see the shakiness of his hand? Okay let's do the same thing here. Try to open it. Here you go, he's able to open it here but it's very slow but here it's just totally stuck. So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck? Yeah it's stuck completely. Now it's hanging up and it's not sticking. Nowhere near as bad as it used to. So before you manually have to do this. Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down? Yeah this is my predominant hand. Yeah I'm glad you're doing better. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Feel free to subscribe to my channel to get helpful tips on how to relieve pain.

Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb is a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and it allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb is a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together.

Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and it allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Most commonly, trigger finger affects the ring finger and the thumb. It's also called synosyntinosynovitis, but it's obviously easier to call it trigger finger. What happens in this condition is the tendons that allow us to move our hands like this actually get stuck, so to speak, in the sheath, the covering of the tendon, or basically the tunnel that they have to travel through in order for us to be able to move our fingers freely. A lot of times this occurs in people that use their hands a lot, and trigger finger might develop just from simple overuse. Typically, if a patient with trigger finger were to go see their doctor, they might be recommended to get a steroid shot to decrease the inflammation of the tendon and the sheath and allow everything to move more freely. In theory, that sounds nice, but the reality is that steroid shots actually increase risk of tendon rupture, which is why people are limited to the number of steroid shots that they could get each year. And people with trigger finger a lot of times may undergo a steroid shot only to find that everything just really comes right back sometime later. Maybe they get a second steroid shot, the same thing happens, and then eventually they're recommended for surgery. What we do is oftentimes a combination of what we call a hydrodissection procedure along with prolotherapy.

Today we're gonna talk about the top three ways to treat trigger finger. Trigger finger, by the way, is an overuse injury. It can range from a slight pain to a severe pain. Generally the biggest sign of it is you'll bend your finger and then as you open it, it snaps open. - Okay. - It might give you a little bit of pain. - So when you say overuse, give me an example. - If you're like working on the garden, and you're using a clipper. - Okay. And you clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, that would do it, a lot of industrial jobs. - Factory type work? - Right, where you're using the hand over and over again. - Yep. - Very common in older women who are menopausal. - Oh, really? - Yeah, so that really doesn't have to do with the overuse, but it does hit the group that tends to get it. - Because of the calcium issues? - I have no idea, Brad. - Okay. - But it very commonly affects the thumb, the ring finger, and the middle finger. - Okay. - But it can happen in any finger, and it can happen really at almost any joint. - Okay. - Should we try to explain this, Brad? - Sure. - Just real quickly? - Let's just use our model here with Leopold. - Napoleon, bone apart. - Napoleon. - All right, we have a long ligament here, ligaments that run up into your finger here. And when you pull on them, they actually bend the finger. - Right. So the muscle is up here. When the muscle contracts, the tendon... Now every finger would have this red tendon, but they're not red in your body. But if you look at the tendon- - There's actually two tendons that actually even go through there. - Yeah. So if you look at that finger... - See how it's bending it? When he pulls on the rope, it bends it. - Look at that. - Yeah. - It goes much easier in real life, of course. - And these tendons are running underneath this black thing, which is a ligament. - Yeah. - It's an annular ligament, and you actually call it a pulley. And that pulley helps hold the ligaments in place. - This a very crude model. - This is very crude. And what we are trying to show right here is a nodule. A nodule has developed on the tendon, and that nodule actually gets caught underneath the ligament here. - So right there you can see it goes underneath the ligament, and then that's where it gets caught. And that's when you straighten the finger, that's when it pops out. - It pops out. Yep, simple as that. So a little bit difficult to understand, but generally if you have trigger finger at this finger right here, you're gonna feel a nodule right here, quite often. - Okay. - So the first treatment you're gonna do is what we call cross fiber massage, or transverse friction massage. Basically, you're gonna find that nodule in this whole area here, and you're gonna rub across it. I don't know how we do it on this man. So you're gonna rub very hard across that. I'm not just hitting the surface here, I'm going down really, really deep, and rubbing. - Could you actually put your finger across so you got some support in the back, and push with your thumb, and go back and forth? - I think you could do that, but you really don't need to. You can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job. - And how long would you do that for, Bob? - I would do it two or three minutes, longer if you could do up to five even, you can do it. - You're probably gonna get fatigued fingers. - Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day. I would do it every day. And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again you're trying to do it on the nodule, and you're trying to do it on the annular ligament. - To loosen that up? - To loosen it all up. 'Cause a lot of times this has got problems too. This is tightened up, and it's got some scar tissue on it. - Sure, okay. - So you wanna do that, and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers. - Okay, I'm gonna pull them back like that. On that specific finger? - On that specific finger. - Sure. - Or if it's the thumb, you could do it on the thumb. - Any red flag things you should- if you feel sharp pain or anything like that, should you stop? - Yeah, you should always be concerned about that, but really the pain is when it snaps open. This usually doesn't bother it. - So if you do this for say three days in a row, you think they may start to feel some progress with it? - Well, we gotta see. The other thing you're gonna do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger. - Okay. - So you're gonna take a rubber band, or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band, and you're gonna put it on your fingers like this, around all the fingers, and then you're just gonna work on straightening them like that. - It's a nice exercise to strengthen the extensors we call them of the fingers. Yeah, and this shouldn't cause any snapping, 'cause in order to make it snap, usually you have to make a full fist, in order to make it snap, to make that tendon or that bump go underneath the ligament. - Sure, that makes sense. - So just like this. And then finally, if you wanna when you finish, you actually can keep the tendon stretched, and you can actually do an ice massage. You wanna show, Brad, how that would be done? - Sure, you take a little dixie cup like this, if you fill it up almost full, put it in your freezer, let it freeze solid. And then when the ice is froze solid in there, you'd tear off the top like this, just enough all the way around so that the ice is exposed, and then you would just rub it over that area. - While you're stretching it. - Okay. For about five minutes is what I usually recommend. - Yeah, it usually doesn't take much longer, sometimes it freezes up a lot quicker than that. You don't need to go much longer than that. Now, if none of these things work, then you're gonna need to go to the doctor, and you can do a cortisone shot. And a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things, in 66% of the patients, but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So only a third of those get lasting relief from the shot. And the others have to have surgery. It's a simple surgery, if there is such a thing, but I mean it's an outpatient. And they go in and they release the tendon. - Right. So you're gonna go in, and leave the same day. - Right, exactly. So this is certainly worth a try. - Right. - So you're gonna do the cross fiber massage, you're gonna do the stretch, you're gonna do the strengthening, and then the ice. Give it a shot, and see if we can help your trigger finger. - All right, nice job, Bob. Thanks for watching."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Today we're gonna talk about the top three ways to treat trigger finger. Trigger finger, by the way, is an overuse injury. It can range from a slight pain to a severe pain. Generally the biggest sign of it is you'll bend your finger and then as you open it, it snaps open. - Okay. - It might give you a little bit of pain. - So when you say overuse, give me an example. - If you're like working on the garden, and you're using a clipper. - Okay. And you clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, that would do it, a lot of industrial jobs. - Factory type work? - Right, where you're using the hand over and over again. - Yep. - Very common in older women who are menopausal. - Oh, really? - Yeah, so that really doesn't have to do with the overuse, but it does hit the group that tends to get it. - Because of the calcium issues? - I have no idea, Brad. - Okay. - But it very commonly affects the thumb, the ring finger, and the middle finger. - Okay. - But it can happen in any finger, and it can happen really at almost any joint. - Okay. - Should we try to explain this, Brad? - Sure. - Just real quickly? - Let's just use our model here with Leopold. - Napoleon, bone apart. - Napoleon. - All right, we have a long ligament here, ligaments that run up into your finger here. And when you pull on them, they actually bend the finger. - Right. So the muscle is up here. When the muscle contracts, the tendon... Now every finger would have this red tendon, but they're not red in your body. But if you look at the tendon- - There's actually two tendons that actually even go through there. - Yeah. So if you look at that finger... - See how it's bending it? When he pulls on the rope, it bends it. - Look at that. - Yeah. - It goes much easier in real life, of course. - And these tendons are running underneath this black thing, which is a ligament. - Yeah. - It's an annular ligament, and you actually call it a pulley. And that pulley helps hold the ligaments in place. - This a very crude model. - This is very crude. And what we are trying to show right here is a nodule. A nodule has developed on the tendon, and that nodule actually gets caught underneath the ligament here. - So right there you can see it goes underneath the ligament, and then that's where it gets caught. And that's when you straighten the finger, that's when it pops out. - It pops out. Yep, simple as that. So a little bit difficult to understand, but generally if you have trigger finger at this finger right here, you're gonna feel a nodule right here, quite often. - Okay. - So the first treatment you're gonna do is what we call cross fiber massage, or transverse friction massage. Basically, you're gonna find that nodule in this whole area here, and you're gonna rub across it. I don't know how we do it on this man. So you're gonna rub very hard across that. I'm not just hitting the surface here, I'm going down really, really deep, and rubbing. - Could you actually put your finger across so you got some support in the back, and push with your thumb, and go back and forth? - I think you could do that, but you really don't need to. You can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job. - And how long would you do that for, Bob? - I would do it two or three minutes, longer if you could do up to five even, you can do it. - You're probably gonna get fatigued fingers. - Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day. I would do it every day. And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again you're trying to do it on the nodule, and you're trying to do it on the annular ligament. - To loosen that up? - To loosen it all up. 'Cause a lot of times this has got problems too. This is tightened up, and it's got some scar tissue on it. - Sure, okay. - So you wanna do that, and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers. - Okay, I'm gonna pull them back like that. On that specific finger? - On that specific finger. - Sure. - Or if it's the thumb, you could do it on the thumb. - Any red flag things you should- if you feel sharp pain or anything like that, should you stop? - Yeah, you should always be concerned about that, but really the pain is when it snaps open. This usually doesn't bother it. - So if you do this for say three days in a row, you think they may start to feel some progress with it? - Well, we gotta see. The other thing you're gonna do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger. - Okay. - So you're gonna take a rubber band, or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band, and you're gonna put it on your fingers like this, around all the fingers, and then you're just gonna work on straightening them like that. - It's a nice exercise to strengthen the extensors we call them of the fingers. Yeah, and this shouldn't cause any snapping, 'cause in order to make it snap, usually you have to make a full fist, in order to make it snap, to make that tendon or that bump go underneath the ligament. - Sure, that makes sense. - So just like this. And then finally, if you wanna when you finish, you actually can keep the tendon stretched, and you can actually do an ice massage. You wanna show, Brad, how that would be done? - Sure, you take a little dixie cup like this, if you fill it up almost full, put it in your freezer, let it freeze solid. And then when the ice is froze solid in there, you'd tear off the top like this, just enough all the way around so that the ice is exposed, and then you would just rub it over that area. - While you're stretching it. - Okay. For about five minutes is what I usually recommend. - Yeah, it usually doesn't take much longer, sometimes it freezes up a lot quicker than that. You don't need to go much longer than that. Now, if none of these things work, then you're gonna need to go to the doctor, and you can do a cortisone shot. And a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things, in 66% of the patients, but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So only a third of those get lasting relief from the shot. And the others have to have surgery. It's a simple surgery, if there is such a thing, but I mean it's an outpatient. And they go in and they release the tendon. - Right. So you're gonna go in, and leave the same day. - Right, exactly. So this is certainly worth a try. - Right. - So you're gonna do the cross fiber massage, you're gonna do the stretch, you're gonna do the strengthening, and then the ice. Give it a shot, and see if we can help your trigger finger. - All right, nice job, Bob. Thanks for watching."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

And you clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, that would do it, a lot of industrial jobs. - Factory type work? - Right, where you're using the hand over and over again. - Yep. - Very common in older women who are menopausal. - Oh, really? - Yeah, so that really doesn't have to do with the overuse, but it does hit the group that tends to get it. - Because of the calcium issues? - I have no idea, Brad. - Okay. - But it very commonly affects the thumb, the ring finger, and the middle finger. - Okay. - But it can happen in any finger, and it can happen really at almost any joint. - Okay. - Should we try to explain this, Brad? - Sure. - Just real quickly? - Let's just use our model here with Leopold. - Napoleon, bone apart. - Napoleon. - All right, we have a long ligament here, ligaments that run up into your finger here. And when you pull on them, they actually bend the finger. - Right. So the muscle is up here. When the muscle contracts, the tendon... Now every finger would have this red tendon, but they're not red in your body. But if you look at the tendon- - There's actually two tendons that actually even go through there. - Yeah. So if you look at that finger... - See how it's bending it? When he pulls on the rope, it bends it. - Look at that. - Yeah. - It goes much easier in real life, of course. - And these tendons are running underneath this black thing, which is a ligament. - Yeah. - It's an annular ligament, and you actually call it a pulley. And that pulley helps hold the ligaments in place. - This a very crude model. - This is very crude. And what we are trying to show right here is a nodule. A nodule has developed on the tendon, and that nodule actually gets caught underneath the ligament here. - So right there you can see it goes underneath the ligament, and then that's where it gets caught. And that's when you straighten the finger, that's when it pops out. - It pops out. Yep, simple as that. So a little bit difficult to understand, but generally if you have trigger finger at this finger right here, you're gonna feel a nodule right here, quite often. - Okay. - So the first treatment you're gonna do is what we call cross fiber massage, or transverse friction massage. Basically, you're gonna find that nodule in this whole area here, and you're gonna rub across it. I don't know how we do it on this man. So you're gonna rub very hard across that. I'm not just hitting the surface here, I'm going down really, really deep, and rubbing. - Could you actually put your finger across so you got some support in the back, and push with your thumb, and go back and forth? - I think you could do that, but you really don't need to. You can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job. - And how long would you do that for, Bob? - I would do it two or three minutes, longer if you could do up to five even, you can do it. - You're probably gonna get fatigued fingers. - Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day. I would do it every day. And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again you're trying to do it on the nodule, and you're trying to do it on the annular ligament. - To loosen that up? - To loosen it all up. 'Cause a lot of times this has got problems too. This is tightened up, and it's got some scar tissue on it. - Sure, okay. - So you wanna do that, and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers. - Okay, I'm gonna pull them back like that. On that specific finger? - On that specific finger. - Sure. - Or if it's the thumb, you could do it on the thumb. - Any red flag things you should- if you feel sharp pain or anything like that, should you stop? - Yeah, you should always be concerned about that, but really the pain is when it snaps open. This usually doesn't bother it. - So if you do this for say three days in a row, you think they may start to feel some progress with it? - Well, we gotta see. The other thing you're gonna do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger. - Okay. - So you're gonna take a rubber band, or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band, and you're gonna put it on your fingers like this, around all the fingers, and then you're just gonna work on straightening them like that. - It's a nice exercise to strengthen the extensors we call them of the fingers. Yeah, and this shouldn't cause any snapping, 'cause in order to make it snap, usually you have to make a full fist, in order to make it snap, to make that tendon or that bump go underneath the ligament. - Sure, that makes sense. - So just like this. And then finally, if you wanna when you finish, you actually can keep the tendon stretched, and you can actually do an ice massage. You wanna show, Brad, how that would be done? - Sure, you take a little dixie cup like this, if you fill it up almost full, put it in your freezer, let it freeze solid. And then when the ice is froze solid in there, you'd tear off the top like this, just enough all the way around so that the ice is exposed, and then you would just rub it over that area. - While you're stretching it. - Okay. For about five minutes is what I usually recommend. - Yeah, it usually doesn't take much longer, sometimes it freezes up a lot quicker than that. You don't need to go much longer than that. Now, if none of these things work, then you're gonna need to go to the doctor, and you can do a cortisone shot. And a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things, in 66% of the patients, but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So only a third of those get lasting relief from the shot. And the others have to have surgery. It's a simple surgery, if there is such a thing, but I mean it's an outpatient. And they go in and they release the tendon. - Right. So you're gonna go in, and leave the same day. - Right, exactly. So this is certainly worth a try. - Right. - So you're gonna do the cross fiber massage, you're gonna do the stretch, you're gonna do the strengthening, and then the ice. Give it a shot, and see if we can help your trigger finger. - All right, nice job, Bob. Thanks for watching."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

And that pulley helps hold the ligaments in place. - This a very crude model. - This is very crude. And what we are trying to show right here is a nodule. A nodule has developed on the tendon, and that nodule actually gets caught underneath the ligament here. - So right there you can see it goes underneath the ligament, and then that's where it gets caught. And that's when you straighten the finger, that's when it pops out. - It pops out. Yep, simple as that. So a little bit difficult to understand, but generally if you have trigger finger at this finger right here, you're gonna feel a nodule right here, quite often. - Okay. - So the first treatment you're gonna do is what we call cross fiber massage, or transverse friction massage. Basically, you're gonna find that nodule in this whole area here, and you're gonna rub across it. I don't know how we do it on this man. So you're gonna rub very hard across that. I'm not just hitting the surface here, I'm going down really, really deep, and rubbing. - Could you actually put your finger across so you got some support in the back, and push with your thumb, and go back and forth? - I think you could do that, but you really don't need to. You can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job. - And how long would you do that for, Bob? - I would do it two or three minutes, longer if you could do up to five even, you can do it. - You're probably gonna get fatigued fingers. - Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day. I would do it every day. And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again you're trying to do it on the nodule, and you're trying to do it on the annular ligament. - To loosen that up? - To loosen it all up. 'Cause a lot of times this has got problems too. This is tightened up, and it's got some scar tissue on it. - Sure, okay. - So you wanna do that, and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers. - Okay, I'm gonna pull them back like that. On that specific finger? - On that specific finger. - Sure. - Or if it's the thumb, you could do it on the thumb. - Any red flag things you should- if you feel sharp pain or anything like that, should you stop? - Yeah, you should always be concerned about that, but really the pain is when it snaps open. This usually doesn't bother it. - So if you do this for say three days in a row, you think they may start to feel some progress with it? - Well, we gotta see. The other thing you're gonna do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger. - Okay. - So you're gonna take a rubber band, or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band, and you're gonna put it on your fingers like this, around all the fingers, and then you're just gonna work on straightening them like that. - It's a nice exercise to strengthen the extensors we call them of the fingers. Yeah, and this shouldn't cause any snapping, 'cause in order to make it snap, usually you have to make a full fist, in order to make it snap, to make that tendon or that bump go underneath the ligament. - Sure, that makes sense. - So just like this. And then finally, if you wanna when you finish, you actually can keep the tendon stretched, and you can actually do an ice massage. You wanna show, Brad, how that would be done? - Sure, you take a little dixie cup like this, if you fill it up almost full, put it in your freezer, let it freeze solid. And then when the ice is froze solid in there, you'd tear off the top like this, just enough all the way around so that the ice is exposed, and then you would just rub it over that area. - While you're stretching it. - Okay. For about five minutes is what I usually recommend. - Yeah, it usually doesn't take much longer, sometimes it freezes up a lot quicker than that. You don't need to go much longer than that. Now, if none of these things work, then you're gonna need to go to the doctor, and you can do a cortisone shot. And a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things, in 66% of the patients, but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So only a third of those get lasting relief from the shot. And the others have to have surgery. It's a simple surgery, if there is such a thing, but I mean it's an outpatient. And they go in and they release the tendon. - Right. So you're gonna go in, and leave the same day. - Right, exactly. So this is certainly worth a try. - Right. - So you're gonna do the cross fiber massage, you're gonna do the stretch, you're gonna do the strengthening, and then the ice. Give it a shot, and see if we can help your trigger finger. - All right, nice job, Bob. Thanks for watching."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}

Generally the biggest sign of it is you'll bend your finger and then as you open it, it snaps open. - Okay. - It might give you a little bit of pain. - So when you say overuse, give me an example. - If you're like working on the garden, and you're using a clipper. - Okay. And you clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, that would do it, a lot of industrial jobs. - Factory type work? - Right, where you're using the hand over and over again. - Yep. - Very common in older women who are menopausal. - Oh, really? - Yeah, so that really doesn't have to do with the overuse, but it does hit the group that tends to get it. - Because of the calcium issues? - I have no idea, Brad. - Okay. - But it very commonly affects the thumb, the ring finger, and the middle finger. - Okay. - But it can happen in any finger, and it can happen really at almost any joint. - Okay. - Should we try to explain this, Brad? - Sure. - Just real quickly? - Let's just use our model here with Leopold. - Napoleon, bone apart. - Napoleon. - All right, we have a long ligament here, ligaments that run up into your finger here. And when you pull on them, they actually bend the finger. - Right. So the muscle is up here. When the muscle contracts, the tendon... Now every finger would have this red tendon, but they're not red in your body. But if you look at the tendon- - There's actually two tendons that actually even go through there. - Yeah.

And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again you're trying to do it on the nodule, and you're trying to do it on the annular ligament. - To loosen that up? - To loosen it all up. 'Cause a lot of times this has got problems too. This is tightened up, and it's got some scar tissue on it. - Sure, okay. - So you wanna do that, and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers. - Okay, I'm gonna pull them back like that. On that specific finger? - On that specific finger. - Sure. - Or if it's the thumb, you could do it on the thumb. - Any red flag things you should- if you feel sharp pain or anything like that, should you stop? - Yeah, you should always be concerned about that, but really the pain is when it snaps open. This usually doesn't bother it. - So if you do this for say three days in a row, you think they may start to feel some progress with it? - Well, we gotta see. The other thing you're gonna do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger. - Okay. - So you're gonna take a rubber band, or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band, and you're gonna put it on your fingers like this, around all the fingers, and then you're just gonna work on straightening them like that. - It's a nice exercise to strengthen the extensors we call them of the fingers. Yeah, and this shouldn't cause any snapping, 'cause in order to make it snap, usually you have to make a full fist, in order to make it snap, to make that tendon or that bump go underneath the ligament. - Sure, that makes sense. - So just like this. And then finally, if you wanna when you finish, you actually can keep the tendon stretched, and you can actually do an ice massage. You wanna show, Brad, how that would be done? - Sure, you take a little dixie cup like this, if you fill it up almost full, put it in your freezer, let it freeze solid. And then when the ice is froze solid in there, you'd tear off the top like this, just enough all the way around so that the ice is exposed, and then you would just rub it over that area. - While you're stretching it. - Okay. For about five minutes is what I usually recommend. - Yeah, it usually doesn't take much longer, sometimes it freezes up a lot quicker than that. You don't need to go much longer than that. Now, if none of these things work, then you're gonna need to go to the doctor, and you can do a cortisone shot. And a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things, in 66% of the patients, but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So only a third of those get lasting relief from the shot. And the others have to have surgery. It's a simple surgery, if there is such a thing, but I mean it's an outpatient. And they go in and they release the tendon. - Right. So you're gonna go in, and leave the same day. - Right, exactly. So this is certainly worth a try. - Right. - So you're gonna do the cross fiber massage, you're gonna do the stretch, you're gonna do the strengthening, and then the ice. Give it a shot, and see if we can help your trigger finger. - All right, nice job, Bob. Thanks for watching."}], "max_tokens": 2250, "temperature": 1}}
